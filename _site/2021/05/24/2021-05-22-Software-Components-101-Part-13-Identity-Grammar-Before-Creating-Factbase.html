<p>The identity grammar should produce output that is the same as the input.</p>

<p>Check that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v.fb</code> is the same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v.brace</code>.</p>

<p>Eye-ball or use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff</code>.</p>

<p>Look for low-hanging fruit.</p>

<p>[We can always come back and fix errors, so this doesnâ€™t need to be perfect.  The only test will be if the app is good enough for its purposes.  Everything is a fractal, everything is relative, nothing is absolute.  Absolute perfection is not possible.  Trying to attain absolute perfection will retard higher-level learning and progress.  Waterfall design is the process of closing doors behind you, whereas FDD[^fdd] leaves doors open on the assumption that iteration will be needed (design iteration as well as code iteration)].</p>

<p>[^fdd] FDD means Failure Driven Design.</p>

    <h1 id="the-goal">The Goal</h1>
<p>The goal of programming is to control a computer.</p>
<h2 id="secondary-goals">Secondary Goals</h2>
<h3 id="secondary-goal-describe-architecture-to-other-people">Secondary Goal: Describe Architecture to Other People</h3>
<p>It is desirable to describe designs to other people.</p>

<p>For example, in the construction industry,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Architects use drawings and 3D models to describe designs to Engineers</li>
  <li>Engineers use blueprints to describe design details to Construction Workers (Implementors).</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these kinds of communication - drawings, models - are used to describe aspects of the design to other people.</p>

<h4 id="tertiary-goal-automated-checking-of-descriptions">Tertiary Goal: Automated Checking of Descriptions</h4>

<p>In the Construction Industry, drawings are checked manually.</p>

<p>Using computers, it becomes possible to write software that checks aspects of design documentation.</p>

<p>Programmers and programming language designers strive to write software that checks design documents (usually in the form of textual “code”).</p>

<p>IMO, language designers miss the fact that automated checking is only a tertiary goal.</p>

<h3 id="secondary-goal-production-engineering">Secondary Goal: Production Engineering</h3>

<p>Once a design has been vetted (by Architects, Engineers, Testers, etc.), the design can be optimized along a number of dimensions - this is called Production Engineering.</p>

<p>Typically, Production Engineering in software tends towards making a low-cost version of the software, usually taking into account hardware costs that the software is to run on.</p>

<p>Most popular so-called General Purpose programming Languages are actually DSLs for Production Engineering.  I include Haskell, Python, JavaScript, etc., etc., in this list of popular GPLs.</p>

<p>In fact, any programming language that provides the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> operator, or, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arrays</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lists</code>, or, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user-defined types</code>, is usually designed as a DSL for Production Engineering.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Compilation</code> is geared towards Production Engineering.  All languages can be interpreted, but, only some languages can be compiled, after making various trade-offs in the languages themselves.  Interpretation helps with Design and Vetting, Compilation helps with Production Engineering. [Note that, neither is actually geared towards only DI<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">1</a></sup> - communicating designs to other people.]</p>

<h1 id="programming-languages-are-ide-wannabes">Programming Languages Are IDE Wannabes</h1>
<p>Programming languages (GPLs<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup>) are only the tip of the iceberg for controlling computers.</p>

<h1 id="operating-systems-are-ide-wannabes">Operating Systems Are IDE Wannabes</h1>
<p>Operating systems are the only tip of the iceberg for controlling computers.</p>

<h1 id="ide-evolution">IDE Evolution</h1>
<p>What do we want in an IDE?</p>

<p>Given that the primary purpose of programming is controlling computers, we want <em>anything</em> that helps us program computers.</p>

<p>We <em>don’t</em> want to use only one-thing in a one-size-fits-all manner.</p>

<p>We see this kind of desire leaking into GPL designs.</p>

<p>For example, REGEXs<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup> have leaked into some GPLs, giving those GPLs two (2) syntaxes.</p>

<p>As an example of the evolution of IDEs, consider technologies that we already know: C++ and REGEXs.</p>

<p>We want an IDE that has multiple windows that can produce an executable module at the push of a button.</p>

<p>Using only the above already-known technologies, we might expect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a window for writing REGEXs, in REGEX DSL syntax,</li>
  <li>a window for writing replacements after REGEX matching has been successful, in REGEX replacement DSL syntax</li>
  <li>a window for writing Production Engineering code in C++ syntax, with some sort of bauble to show where the REGEX pattern matchers pattern replacers are to be inserted.</li>
</ul>

<p>To illustrate the point, imagine that we want to write a REGEX that replaces all “A”s with “AB”s</p>
<ul>
  <li>we might write /(A)/ in window 1</li>
  <li>we might write /\1B/ in window 2</li>
  <li>we might write some C++ in window 3.</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, we would probably drop the “/” characters in windows 1 and 2.</p>

<p>In the above example, parentheses are use to “remember” parts of the match, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(A)</code> remembers “A” (if matched) and gives it the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\1</code><sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>A simple example of a REGEX visualizer is <a href="https://regex101.com">regex101</a>.</p>

<p>We want something like the REGEX visualizer to become our windows 1 and 2 in our progamming IDE.</p>

<p>Of course, one could re-imagine the above using languages, like Python and JavaScript, that have REGEXs built into them.</p>

<h2 id="further-ideas">Further Ideas:</h2>

<p>I believe that Ohm-JS is better than REGEX.</p>

<p>If we look at the <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/">Ohm-JS IDE</a>, we see the beginnings of what we want in one of the windows of our futuristic IDE.</p>

<p>We would want to augment the IDE with an Ohm-JS replacement window (a replacement rule for every grammar rule in Ohm-JS.  See the <a href="https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/04/11/Glue-Tool.html">glue tool</a> for POC-level ideas for a replacement DSL for Ohm-JS programs.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/07/30/Parsing-Diagrams-DaS-Workbench-Overview.html">DaS Workbench</a> for POC-level ideas on multi-window, heads-up displays for pattern matching and replacement.</p>

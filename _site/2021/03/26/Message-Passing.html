<h1 id="messagepassing">Message Passing</h1>

<p>In my opinion, the term &#8220;message passing&#8221; means &#8220;fire and forget&#8221;.</p>

<p>A single, atomic operation.</p>

<p>Send ().</p>

<p>Asynchronous.</p>

<p>AFAICT, most current, so-called forms of message-passing consist of two atomic operations:</p>

<ol>
<li>Send ()</li>
<li>Wait ().</li>
</ol>

<p>which results in synchronous operation.</p>

<p>Step 2. is usually implied by the use of CALL / RETURN.</p>

<p>A gedanken test of true message-passing would be to convert all instances of all classes into separate threads (ignoring efficiency). One will be forced to convert every &#8220;message send&#8221; into two atomic operations â€” Send (), Wait ().</p>

<p>Synchrony is so pervasive that we have sought ways to force-fit synchrony into inherently asynchronous paradigms (e.g. by using envelopes called threads, by implementing synchronous RPC, etc.).</p>

<h1 id="hardwaresupportglobalvariable">Hardware Support Global Variable</h1>

<p>It should be noted that our hardware, since The Stack was invented,<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> implicitly supports the synchronous CALL / RETURN paradigm by making The Stack into a global variable that records the dynamic call-chain.</p>

<p>CALL modifies The Stack.</p>

<p>RETURN modifies The Stack.</p>

<p>Threads hide the fact The Stack is a global variable, by wrapping envelopes around it.</p>

<h1 id="future">Future</h1>

<p>I believe that part of the future of computing lies in removing the redundant Wait ().</p>

<p>We see it beginning to happen with distributed languages like HTML<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p>We see it beginning to happen with the exploration of languages based on relations, etc.</p>

<p>We see the need for this arising in technologies like p2p and blockchain (which tend to be concerned with asynchronous operations and network protocols).</p>

<p>Early IBM 360s did not have a Stack. Programmers needed to use the BALR instruction. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to body" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

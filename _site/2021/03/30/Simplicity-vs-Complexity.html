<h1 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h1>

<p>A definition of <em>simplicity</em> is</p>

<ul>
<li>lack of nuance.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="complexity">Complexity</h1>

<p>Complexity is the opposite of simplicity.</p>

<p>Complexity occurs in a system when there are too many variables to be juggled, at the same time, in a solution.</p>

<h1 id="simplification">Simplification</h1>

<p>To simplify something does not necessarily mean to delete variables from the system.</p>

<p>One can simplify a problem by subdividing it. Divide and Conquer.</p>

<p>I remember being told that humans can handle 7±2<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> items at a time.</p>

<p>This would imply that one needs to apply Divide-and-Conquer until the number of variables in a subdivision is 7±2.</p>

<p>The number of variables in a <em>system</em> might be more than 7±2, say 100, but no part (subdivision) of the system should have more than 7±2 variables in it.</p>

<h2 id="physicists">Physicists</h2>

<p>Physicists simplify problems using approximations.</p>

<p>When the effect of a variable is much less than (≪) the effect of some other variable, physicists make <em>simplifying assumptions &#8212;</em> they drop (elide) the former variable from their equations, dealing only with the latter variable(s).</p>

<p>This does not mean that one approximation is valid in every situation.</p>

<p>For example, in his book &#8220;Order Out of Chaos&#8221;, Nobel Laureate Ilya Prigogene<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> decries the misuse of approximations that are not valid in certain situations.</p>

<p>Often, people over-use an approximation, or a notation, once it has worked in some domain.</p>

<p>I see this happening in programming, where, often the question is &#8220;how do I re-cast this problem in a strongly-typed, functional manner?&#8221; instead of asking &#8220;what is the problem and how can it best be solved?&#8221; and &#8220;what approximations / notations are useful in this case?&#8221;.</p>

<p>In programming, we see this played out in synchronous notation being misused to solve asynchronous problems (e.g. multitasking and the accidental complexities it brought along) and in &#8220;features&#8221; like JavaScript&#8217;s callbacks.</p>

<h1 id="errors">Errors</h1>

<p>Errors in one domain might not be errors in another domain.</p>

<p>For example, a timeout is an error when building a ballistics calculator, but is an expected occurrence when building blockchain.</p>

<h1 id="tells-approximationmisuse">Tells - Approximation Misuse</h1>

<p>The &#8220;tells&#8221; of misuse of notations and approximations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increasing accidental complexity, e.g. mutexes, then thread safety, then priorities, etc.</li>
<li>Deciding that something is &#8220;hard&#8221;, e.g. the generally agreed-upon notion that multitasking is just &#8220;hard&#8221;.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="divideandconquer">Divide and Conquer</h1>

<p>Successful use of <em>divide and conquer</em> reduces not only the number of variables at the input of a subdivision, but, also, reduces the number of outputs.</p>

<h2 id="fan-inandfan-out">Fan-in and Fan-out</h2>

<p>To be able to apply divide-and-conquer in infinitely many subdivisions<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>4</sup></a> a notation <em>must</em> support reduction of the number of input ports and reduction of the number of output ports.</p>

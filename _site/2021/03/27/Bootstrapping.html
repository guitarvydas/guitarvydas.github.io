<h1 id="bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</h1>

<p>Bootstrapping is a technique used by language designers (including compiler writers).</p>

<p>The idea is to &#8220;test&#8221; a language design by having it compile itself.</p>

<p>This is a form of regression testing + agile-like testing. Bootstrapping goes beyond just code testing, but also tests the basic concepts and UX of the language.</p>

<p>Who is the customer? In the case of a language, the customer is usually other programmers. Bootstrapping tests the language design against a target customer (but only one such customer)</p>

<p>What code tests can be performed? The largest code base for a newly-minted language is, usually, the language implementation, itself.</p>

<p>Bootstrapping can occur in two stages:</p>

<ul>
<li>test generated code against the manual implementation</li>
<li>use the generated code to generate code (again) and diff the generated code against the generated-generated code.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="languageevolution">Language Evolution</h1>

<p>Bootstrapping can show weak points in the language.</p>

<p>The language design is tested and can evolve during bootstrapping.</p>

<h1 id="implementationevolution">Implementation Evolution</h1>

<p>Bootstrapping can show implementation gotchas and cause the implementation to evolve.</p>

<p>Example: as I bootstrap the glue language, I find places wherein I optimized. A compiler would have generated more-normalized code. In particular, I used Ohm-JS&#8217;s capitalization rules and whitespace elimination. Explicit whitespace would have sufficed.</p>

<p>The goal of producing an identity transform pointed this out. Compiler writers never produce identity transforms — they optimize whitespace away early (during the lexing phase).</p>

<p>This simple change — striving for an identity transform — has made it possible to think &#8220;out of the box&#8221;.</p>

<p>Seeing it in this light, shows that the addition of capitalized-uncapitalized rule names in Ohm-JS is a bandaid optimization that does not help automation. This change &#8220;sucks&#8221; users into using it and to not being able to see possibilities for automation (much like the existence of fast registers sucked assembler programmers into manually-writing assembler code instead of automating the process bu using stack variables instead of register variables).</p>

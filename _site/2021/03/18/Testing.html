<h2 style="margin: 24.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Helvetica"><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="p2">I describe some of the testing techniques I encountered.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Some of these techniques were for hardware testing, but might give ideas for software testing.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 24.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Helvetica"><b>Back to Back Testing</b></h2>
<p class="p2">Mitel built PBXs.<a id="fnlink1"></a><a href="#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">At the very end of testing, we took two "finished" PBXs and pointed them at each other. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">The PBXs would self-test by calling each other many times.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">One should be able to do this with a class.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Make two instances, then have the instances talk to one another.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">If this sounds hard and undoable, your organization needs a Test Engineer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Someone whose job it is to kibitz designers on how to make their classes more testable.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">If this becomes a UX issue, look at sikulix, <a href="http://sikulix.com/">http://sikulix.com/</a>.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 24.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Helvetica"><b>Regression Testing (HP Trace Analyzer)</b></h2>
<p class="p2">We used regression testing on hardware.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">CI tools do this now.<a id="fnlink2"></a><a href="#fn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">For hardware, we took a "golden" known-to-be-working board and used an HP Trace Analyzer on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It recorded repeatable signatures (collapsed down to some kind of hash value) for certain input streams.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Boards/circuits-under-test were deemed "good" if they generated the same signatures (for the same inputs).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the signatures were wrong, the circuit-under-test would be put aside for further testing.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 24.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Helvetica"><b>Coverage Testing</b></h2>
<p class="p2">When alpha-testing software, we used <i>coverage testing</i>.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">We created an input dataset that hit every piece of code at least once.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">This got rid of blunders and typos.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Designers also discovered dead code with this test.<a id="fnlink3"></a><a href="#fn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Using SCLs makes this option particularly attractive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since the code is generated, we could modify the transpilers to insert anything into the generated code and have it automagically appear.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 24.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Helvetica"><b>NorTel</b></h2>
<p class="p2">NorTel used to have a policy about bug fixes.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Bug fixes did not remove code, they just added edge-cases that were specialized to find and shunt only the conditions that made the bugs appear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fixes went into the shunt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The original code was mostly left alone.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Telecoms, like NorTel, Mitel and Bell used to pride themselves on <i>four nines </i>guarantees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They guaranteed that their systems would have uptimes of 99.99%.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 24.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Helvetica"><b>Banking Y2K</b></h2>
<p class="p2">We worked on the Y2K problem at some big banks.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">They had a policy that they would not test during the work week.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Testing could only be done on Saturdays, leaving Sundays for reverting back to the previous code if problems occurred.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Furthermore, one weekend was reserved for month-end consolidation.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Another weekend was reserved for "maintenance" upgrades.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">I forget what the third weekend was reserved for, but we were left with one day every month (1 Saturday for new code, 1 Sunday for reverting if needed).</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Then, there was year-end.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Data spread was uneven, because month-ends came at different times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We couldn't just generate fake data in a repetitive manner, we had to fake the calendar and all month-ends.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Generating the fake data needed as much compute-power as was used for live banking.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Starting in, say 1996, the Banks needed to generate 4 years worth of fake data but could only test it on one day of every month. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Most of the code was written in COBOL.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some in assembler.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not all source code could be found.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Some of the "date" affected code had names like "Nancy", "Jane", etc.<a id="fnlink4"></a><a href="#fn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">The Banks were set up to touch maybe 5% of their code per year.<a id="fnlink5"></a><a href="#fn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">The Y2K problem affected something like 30% of the code.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">The <i>testing</i> problem turned out to be harder than the actual <i>fixing</i> problem.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">We started by trying to auto-fix the code.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This affected too much of the code.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the end, we just generated reports and let the maintainers fix the code.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their wetware made the effort possible — they could tell which things really needed to be fixed and which were red herrings.</p>

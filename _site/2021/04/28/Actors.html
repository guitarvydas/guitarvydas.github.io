<h1 id="actors">Actors</h1>

<p>Actors are single-paradigm.</p>

<p>Not all kinds of solutions fit, cleanly, into the Actors paradigm.</p>

<p>For example, <em>printf</em> and JS back-tick strings are pretty good at formatting output. OO, FP, Actors, PROLOG, etc.. don&#8217;t make it easier to format output.</p>

<p>For example, REGEX is pretty good at matching text. OO, FP, Actors, PROLOG, etc., don&#8217;t make it easier to match text. REGEX breaks down into an unreadable mess when patterns become complicated. Maybe there is something better than REGEX for use in such cases? Not OO, not FP, not Actors, et al. PEG comes to mind.</p>

<h1 id="scns">SCNs</h1>

<p>My emphasis is on solving problems by creating specific notations for specific problem and having a bunch of paradigms in one&#8217;s toolbelt. This attitude is very different from the language, heavy-weight language, design paradigm that is in vogue. Paradigms are interesting and hard to learn. Languages &#8212; syntax &#8212; are noise.</p>

<p>What if building a compiler was easy?<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>What if all notations were as easy-to-use as REGEX?</p>

<p>Paradigms should not be dumbed down to assembler. Maybe each paradigm could come with a suggested syntax? Maybe we could just mix-and-match paradigms and suggested syntaxes?</p>

<p>What if we could use many paradigms &#8212; and many syntaxes &#8212; to solve one problem?</p>

<p>What if SCN-building was so cheap that we could just switch to any paradigm we wanted for a given problem? For example, using REGEX to input line-oriented data, PROLOG to perform queries, and printf to write out reports.</p>

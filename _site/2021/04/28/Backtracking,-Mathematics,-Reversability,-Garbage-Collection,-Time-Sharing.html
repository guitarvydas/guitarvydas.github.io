<h1 id="backtracking">Backtracking</h1>

<p>I&#8217;ve stopped using the phrase &#8220;backtracking&#8221; and try to use the phrase &#8220;exhaustive search&#8221;. Backtracking is an implementation detail, &#8220;exhaustive search&#8221; is a semantic concept that doesn&#8217;t imply how it&#8217;s implemented.</p>

<p>Note that Microsoft Word has had &#8220;exhaustive search&#8221; for a loooong time (WordStar had it before Word. Ed/vi/emacs?). Grep could do exhaustive search. We should&#8217;a turned left at Albuquerque (<em>Bugs Bunny</em>).</p>

<p>Mathematics notation employs exhaustive search. The strive for immutability is in aid of exhaustive search.</p>

<p>Mathematics is 2 things: (1) a pencil-and-paper notation that employs exhaustive search and (2) a body of experience with using that notation.</p>

<p>Reversability. Who cares? No one asked for reversability, but it was a side-effect of immutability and now has risen to the level of an ideology.</p>

<p>Reversability can be used to solve one class of problems - UNDO. Should we be forced to bolt UNDO into every app? We seem to force ourselves to bolt time-sharing into every app. Is this a good thing? (If we were allowed to use multiple paradigms, we would be able to choose time-sharing and UNDO when we actually needed it, instead of having it built-into every language we use).</p>

<p>Garbage collection might have been the latest useful feature that we invented. Is UNDO in that same class? (I don&#8217;t know, this is rhetorical question).</p>

<p>Time-sharing came about due to premature optimization (we optimized CPU usage instead of believing in Moore&#8217;s Law). Are we making the same mistake again?</p>

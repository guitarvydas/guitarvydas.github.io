<h1 id="codeeditingsubdivided">Code Editing Subdivided</h1>

<p>It must be possible to edit (and save) incomplete, incorrect code.</p>

<p>Coding can be subdivided into two activities:</p>

<ul>
<li>development - code is incomplete</li>
<li>maintenance - code is meant to be complete.</li>
</ul>

<p>Should the same editor be used for both phases?</p>

<p>Emacs indents code automatically.</p>

<p>During development, this activity &#8212; automatic indentation &#8212; can be annoying. During development, the editor should be &#8220;dumb&#8221; and indentation be performed only when explicitly asked for. Maybe, the developer wants &#8220;some&#8221; indentation, but not enough to be annoying.</p>

<p>During maintenance, though, indentation should be automatic. Indentation is based on language syntax and offers a first-line-of-defence against entering incorrect code.</p>

<p>This subdivision and argument boils down to the idea of two syntaxes for every language &#8212; a <em>writing</em> syntax and a <em>reading</em> syntax.</p>

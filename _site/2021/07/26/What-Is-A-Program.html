  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>From my perspective, a <em>computer</em> is a <em>machine</em> that can be used to augment human capabilities.</p>

<p>We want to learn how to control such machines.</p>

<p>This leads to the question of “what is a programming language?”.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-programming-language">What Is A Programming Language?</h1>

<p>One view of a PL<sup id="fnref:PL" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:PL" class="footnote">1</a></sup> is that it is a way to command the computer to do <em>what is needed</em>.</p>

<p>Another view might be that a PL is a way to command a computer to do what the <em>programmer thinks is needed</em>.</p>

<p>The former perspective involves the end-user (aka the customer).</p>

<p>The latter perspective does not involve the end-user directly<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Question: Is a Programming Language intended only for programming nodes on a network, or, is a progamming language intended for programming the complete network (i.e. a language for networks)?</p>

<h1 id="calculators-are-a-sub-class-of-computers">Calculators Are A Sub-Class Of Computers</h1>

<p>One use of computers is to build calculators.</p>

<p>Input <em>something</em>, and always expect to receive a <em>result</em>.</p>

<p>This is less than what computers are capable of doing.</p>

<h1 id="functions-are-calculators">Functions Are Calculators</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Functions are synchronous.</li>
  <li>Functions alway return some kind of result.</li>
  <li>Functions receive inputs in synchronous blocks (parameter lists).</li>
  <li>Functions produce results in synchronous blocks (return values and exceptions).</li>
  <li><em>Calling a function</em> is a scheduling decision and overrides the Dispatcher(). (The caller schedules the callee to execute immediately. The caller suspends until a result has been produced).</li>
  <li>Functional notation does not include the notion of a component that does not return a result. [<em>This might be akin to the difference between Natural Numbers and Whole Numbers - 0</em>].</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="computers-contain-state">Computers Contain State</h1>

<p>Computers can contain state.</p>

<p>For example, a server on a network might remember which client(s) it is producing responses for.</p>

<p>As such, computers are a superset of what is commonly called FP (functional programming).</p>

<p>FP is a useful notation for a portion of computing.</p>

<h1 id="computers-contain-history---computers-are-functions-of-time">Computers Contain History - Computers Are Functions of Time</h1>

<p>Computers can contain history.</p>

<p>For example, a server on a network might remember which client(s) it is producing responses for and in which state each of those responses is.</p>

<p>As such, computers are a superset of what is commonly called FP (functional programming).</p>

<p>FP ignores the dimension of <em>time</em>.  It is <em>possible</em> to represent <em>time</em> in FP, but it is not inherent to the notation.</p>

<p>FP is a useful notation for a portion of computing.</p>

<h1 id="sequencing">Sequencing</h1>

<p>Sequencing means function-of-time.</p>

<p>Music is a hard-realtime activity.</p>

<p>[<em>We teach this hard-realtime notation to 5-year-olds<sup id="fnref:realtime" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:realtime" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, yet, programmers continue to struggle with the concepts of realtime.</em>]</p>

<h2 id="daws">DAWs</h2>

<p>DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) control audio-generating computers in sequence.</p>

<h2 id="imovie-obs-davinci-resolve-etc">iMovie, OBS, DaVinci Resolve, Etc.</h2>

<p>Video editors are like DAWs - they control and edit sequences of video (and audio) clips.</p>

<h1 id="4d-to-2d-mapping">4D to 2D Mapping</h1>

<p>I like to think of computers as dealing with 4D - x, y, z, t.</p>

<p>Textual progamming languages tend to map this 4D space to 2D space (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x,y,z,t</code> mapped to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x,y</code>).</p>

<p>Actually, textual GPLs tend to map 4D to 1½D.  X tends to represented as character offsets and Y tends to be represented as line numbers.</p>

<p>In this kind of mapping, character cells are not allowed to overlap.</p>

<p>This perspective is a hold-over from paper-based typesetting.</p>

<p>Computers are capable of representing cells which overlap, but, most GPLs do not allow for this possibility.</p>

<h1 id="complexity">Complexity</h1>

<p>This mapping makes progamming languages appear to be complicated.</p>

<p>The choice of mappings can make some operations appear more complicated than others.</p>

<h1 id="software-architecture">Software Architecture</h1>

<p>There are many ways to map 4 dimensions onto 2 dimensions.</p>

<p>Software Architecture is the act of <em>choosing</em> mappings.</p>

<h1 id="multiple-notations">Multiple Notations</h1>

<p>There are many ways to map 4 dimensions onto 2 dimensions.</p>

<p>Sticking to only one mapping results in accidental complexity.</p>

<p>Multiple notations should be used in every solution<sup id="fnref:toy" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:toy" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It is fruitless to pursue/explore the use of <em>only</em> one notation.</p>

<h1 id="layers">Layers</h1>

<p>A solution should be built in layers.</p>

<p>Each layer must be understandable in its entirety.</p>

<p>For example, the field of psychology determined that humans can understand 7±2 concepts at any one time. This implies that a <em>layer</em> should contain no more than 7±2 components / concepts (lines of code, components, functionalities, etc.)</p>

<p>A layered approach does not mean that details are ignored, it simply means that details are suppressed (elided) to lower layers.</p>

<p>Programming research should be expended on the issues of how to combine layers to produce final (otherwise-complicated) applications. Complicated applications should be broken down into a set of single, uncomplicated concepts. Corrolary: much research has been conducted on perfecting the notion of single programming languages, now, we need research on how to join (pipeline, overlay) such languages to produce applications.</p>

<p>Question: How can developers overlay languages (like acetates used in original Disney cartoons)?</p>

<p>Question: How can developers plug software components together like LEGO® blocks<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">5</a></sup>?</p>

<h2 id="scoping">Scoping</h2>

<p>Scoping is a layered approach applied to the problem of <em>global variables</em>.</p>

<p>Global variables are not a problem.</p>

<p>Unrestrictd use of global variables is a problem.</p>

<p>Scoping is a layered approach to restricting the use of variables.</p>

<h2 id="structured-programming">Structured Programming</h2>

<p>Structured Programming is a layered approach applied to the problem of unrestricted use of GOTOs.</p>

<p>GOTOs are not a problem.</p>

<p>Unrestricted use of GOTOs is a problem.</p>

<p>Structured programming is a layered approach to restricting the use of GOTOs.</p>

<h1 id="servers-run-forever">Servers Run Forever</h1>

<p>Servers are built using the notion that they run forever / continuously.</p>

<p>It is considered to be a bug if a server stops working.</p>

<p>FP notation does not, inherently, include the concept of “run forever”.  Functions spring to life, then die.</p>

<h1 id="outdated-concepts">Outdated Concepts</h1>

<h2 id="time-sharing">Time-Sharing</h2>

<p>Time-sharing was invented in the 1950’s when CPUs were expensive.</p>

<p>Time-sharing leads to numerous forms of accidental complexity, e.g. preemption, thread safety, etc.</p>

<p>The ground rules have changed.</p>

<p>CPUs are no longer expensive.</p>

<p>Yet, we continue to install time-sharing into most applications (for example, via thread libraries)</p>

<h2 id="memory-sharing">Memory-Sharing</h2>

<p>Memory-sharing was invented in the 1950’s when memory was expensive.</p>

<p>Thread safety is an example of accidental complexity arising from the use of memory sharing.</p>

<p>The ground rules have changed.</p>

<p>Memory is no longer expensive.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-computing">Distributed Computing</h2>

<p>The concepts of <em>distributed computing</em> (internet, blockchain, p2p, etc.) challenge the basic tenets of how software is currently constructed.</p>

<h2 id="loopsrecursion">Loops/Recursion</h2>

<p>The concepts of loops and recursion are non-starters in distributed computing environments<sup id="fnref:loops" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:loops" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Loops/recursion should be the exception, not the norm, in new programming languages.</p>

<h2 id="callreturn">Call/Return</h2>

<p>Call/Return is a synchronization primitive.</p>

<p>Call/Return is a scheduling decision.</p>

<p>Call/Return is implemented - in hardware - using a global variable (SP - the stack pointer).</p>

<p>In <em>distributed computing</em> the concept of call/return does not exist.</p>

<p>[<em>Call/return can be used to program nodes in a network but does not inherently exist in distributed computing.  Programmers have stretched the synchronous metaphor to include RPC (remote procedure call), but this is not a fundamental concept of true distributed computing</em>.]</p>

<h1 id="fbp">FBP</h1>

<p>FBP means Flow Based Programming.</p>

<p>Flow-based programming treats data as physical objects on a conveyor-belt.</p>

<p>Asynchronous components process data as it arrives (on the conveyor belts).</p>

<p>FBP component have input and output <em>ports</em>.</p>

<p>FBP components can <em>pull</em> and <em>push</em> data.</p>

<h2 id="rust-like-ownership">Rust-Like Ownership</h2>

<p>FBP uses <em>ownership</em>.</p>

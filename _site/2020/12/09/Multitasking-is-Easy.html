<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Multi-tasking is easy.</p>
<p class="p3">Multi-tasking has been conflated with the harder problems of <i>time-sharing</i> and <i>memory-management</i>.</p>
<p class="p3">Time-sharing is useful to only a small set of domains – sharing a computer between multiple users. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">This used to be an important consideration when CPUs were expensive (and not well-understood) and when memory was expensive.</p>
<p class="p3">Conflating multi-tasking with time-sharing and memory-sharing has caused large amounts of accidental complexity.</p>
<p class="p3">When cost and time-sharing and memory-sharing are dropped from the equation, we are left with the bare essentials of multi-tasking – a number of distributed processor<a id="fnlink1"></a><a href="#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> nodes communicating with one another across wires.</p>
<p class="p3">I know of no popular programming languages that target the design of such simple distributed systems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most common programming languages target the design of single nodes within such a simple network.</p>
<p class="p3">There are some languages that target this domain, like <i>bash</i>, FBP,<a id="fnlink2"></a><a href="#fn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and coordination languages, but they are not very popular.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Bash</i> is relatively popular, but it is not recognized as a bona-fide programming language.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Concurrency</i> is a design paradigm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Parallelism </i>is a design issue and should not be conflated with <i>concurrency</i>.<a id="fnlink3"></a><a href="#fn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A parallel solution requires the use of the concurrent paradigm, but, the concurrent paradigm does not imply parallelism.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Time-sharing</i> has been conflated with <i>parallelism</i> which has been conflated with <i>concurrency</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This conflation has caused much confusion and has caused much accidental complexity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Parallelism</i> has, further, been conflated with <i>memory-sharing</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A further complication is the use of a text-only syntax to describe <i>time-shared, parallel</i> solutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This text-only fixation, has led to complicated concepts like <i>futures</i>, <i>promises, exceptions, etc., </i>all of which can be more simply described in a concurrent paradigm.</p>

- what if our concept of *evolution* is *exactly* backwards?
	- the most primitive entities are ad-hoc combinations of capabilities, requiring sexual reproduction
	- more refined entities have fewer, but more specific capabilities, and, require only asexual reproduction
		- bacteria exhibit "quorum sensing" https://www.ted.com/talks/bonnie_bassler_how_bacteria_talk?language=en
- why were animals so much bigger in the past?
	- was there less gravity holding their growth back?
- why are ancient things buried in the ground?
	- where does the extra dirt (covering material) come from?
	- if there is conservation of dirt, some artefacts would be deeply buried, while other artefacts would be uncovered and just lying on the surface of the ground
- are we just a kind of A.I. that overtook its creating race?

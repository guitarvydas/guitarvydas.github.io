# Refactoring Architecture

The ultimate goal is to refactor _architecture_.

Refactoring *code* is but a low-level subset of refactoring *architecture*.

# One Line Of Code

The ultimate goal is to write a full application in one line of code[^apl].

Lots of thinking with very little coding.

## Refactoring is a Tell 

The need to refactor is a *tell* that something is wrong.

Refactoring means that the paradigm being used does not suit the problem-at-hand. 

[^apl]: I came close to describing a complete solution in one line of code in APL, but that was one very complicated line of code.  Simplicity is more important than complexity.

title:  "Refactoring Takeaways - Architecture"

# Refactoring Architecture

The goal is to refactor _architecture_.

Refactoring code is but a low-level subset of refactoring architecture.

# One Line Of Code

The goal is to write a full application in one line of code[^apl].

Lots of thinking - very little coding.

## Efficiency

The biggest efficiency gains come from refactoring architecture, not code.

Using, say Rust, will not buy you efficiency if your architecture sucks.

If you have more than one page of code, then it is safe to say that your architecture sucks.

## Writing Less Code
- Lisp As A Way To Write Less Code
- Diagrams As A Way To Write Less Code
## Writing Code in Other Languages
Python, Perl, etc. are _someone else's_ ideas of how to structure a solution. 

These ideas do not necessarily fit _your_ problem-at-hand.
## Whiteboards
## Scalability
## Org Charts
Business oranizations are built in a scalable manner.

Business organizations are described by Org Charts.
## Music Notation

Why can 5-year olds understand hard-realtime notation when Computer Science PhD's still have a hard time dealing with concurrency?

## Mars Rover Disaster
What was the [Mars Rover disaster](https://www.rapitasystems.com/blog/what-really-happened-software-mars-pathfinder-spacecraft)?


[^apl]: I came close to describing a complete solution in one line of code in APL, but that was one very complicated line of code.  Simplicity is more important than complexity.

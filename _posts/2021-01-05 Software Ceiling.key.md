Something more than “programming”?## Slide 23### Title: New Technology#### Body Is this just a different twist on existing S/W?Is this just the QWERTY effect?More than one technology?## Slide 24### Title: QWERTY Effect#### Body Technology lock-inIncrementalQWERTY vs. other keyboard layoutsVHS vs. Beta808x vs. other CPU designsInhibiting TechnologyStops progress?Different category?## Slide 25### Title: >1 Uses of Computers#### Body CalculatorEvent-Driven Controllers## Slide 26### Title: Computers As Calculators#### Body BallisticsCryptography (not Blockchain!)One-in-one-outSynchronousHard to implement asynchronous paradigm Functions, FP## Slide 27### Title: One-in One-out(Computers as Calculators)#### Body One-in-one-outOne input —> One outcomeExceptions are a “special case” tacked onto the side## Slide 28### Title: Synchronous(Computers as Calculators)#### Body Attempts to add async to calculator paradigmAccidental Complexity <— using unsuitable paradigme.g. Mars Rover disasterHard to implement asynchronous paradigm in synchronous paradigmEpicycles on top of epicyclesThreads, promises, various baubles, etc.)## Slide 29### Title: Functional Approach(Computers as Calculators)#### Body Ilya Prigogene (Nobel laureate) “Order Out Of Chaos”[paraphrased] Functional thinking has set Physics back 100 yearsFP - Functional ProgrammingEschew timeEschew STATE## Slide 30### Title: CALL RETURN(Computers as Calculators)#### Body Implicitly uses The StackCreates dynamic record of invocations —> dependencyAccidental complexityUseful only in calculator model of computing## Slide 31### Title: Global Variable (Hidden)(Computers as Calculators)#### Body All PLs, incl. FP and Smalltalk, share a global variableThe StackCALL / RETURN manipulates this global variable## Slide 32### Title: Computers for Event-Driven Control#### Body AsynchronousMultiple OutcomesEschew DependenciesImplement synchronous paradigmIsolationExamples## Slide 33### Title: Asynchronous(Event-Driven Control)#### Body Events come at any timee.g. GUIe.g. Browsere.g. mousee.g. keyboard## Slide 34### Title: Multiple Outcomes(Event-Driven Control)#### Body Multiple OutcomesOne input —> multiple possible outcomesOne input —> no outcomesExample, javascript FileReader()## Slide 35### Title: Eschew Dependencies(Event-Driven Control)#### Body Scalability requires lack of dependency## Slide 36### Title: Implement Synchronous Paradigm Using Asynchronous Paradigm(Event-Driven Control)#### Body Blocking <— ACK/NAKAlready exploredNetworkingElectronics## Slide 37### Title: Isolation(Event-Driven Control)#### Body Isolation is more important than encapsulationEncapsulate data and control flow## Slide 38### Title: Examples(Event-Driven Control)#### Body Statechartshttps://computingsimplicity.neocities.org/blogs/StateCharts.pdf## Slide 39### Title: Blockchain#### Body Two paradigms (not one)1. Calculation <— cryptography2. Event-driven <— time-based obfuscation and p2p

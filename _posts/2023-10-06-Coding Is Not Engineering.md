# Coding Is Not Engineering

Civil Engineers who design buildings don't build buildings and don't lay bricks.

Civil Engineers *think* about designs for solutions to *specific* problems and communicate those designs to brick-layers using *blueprints*.

Software Engineers shouldn't need to write code.

Software Engineers *think* about designs for solutions to *specific* problems and communicate those designs to coders using `<???>`.

Currently, Software Engineers are forced to lay bricks and hope that other engineers and brick-layers can reverse-engineer the design intentions from how the bricks were laid.

Most existing "general purpose" programming languages - like Rust, Python, Haskell, JavaScript, etc. - are brick-laying languages, not blueprint languages for describing engineering designs and trade-offs.

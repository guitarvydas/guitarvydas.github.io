Sometimes, you need to find a word that captures the essence of a concept.

If the word is not immediately apparent, it helps to brainstorm with a thesaurus.  Sometimes a rhyming dictionary helps, too.

Browsing rhymes usually doesn't hit on the word directly, but, can trigger other thoughts about how to express the concept.

I tend to use rhymezone.com and b-rhymes.com.  In fact, I usually just type a search into google.com, like "synonym static"

## Use-Case

Recently, a question was asked on reddit about finding a better word than 'static'.

Searching thesaurus.com results in: https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/static .

Search b-rhymes.com results in: http://www.b-rhymes.com/rhyme/word/static .

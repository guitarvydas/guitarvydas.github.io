# Functional Programming

- pattern matching
- isolation
- calculators

# Pattern Matching
A.K.A. parsing.

Parsing came from compiler technology.

The latest manifestation of parsing is PEG. 

PEG is like REGEX, but more flexible.

# Isolation
Immutability is a subset of isolation.

# Calculators
FP formalizes the creation of calculator apps, e.g. one-in, one-out, synchronous.

title:  "ABC Glue"

This note is a follow-on to [abc](https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/09/15/Small-Example-of-Interpreting-and-Compiling.html).

I show how to build a transpiler for the ABC language in about 20 lines of code.

I use:
- the _ftranspile()_ function (from _transpiler.js_)
- abc.glue - a specification of the transpiler in the _Glue_ SCN[^1].

_Ftranspile()_ and _glue_ are auxiliary libraries built on top of Ohm-JS.

[^1]: SCN means Solution Centric Notation.

# The ABC Language
This is the most-trivial language that I could imagine, that also shows how to get started using Ohm-JS.

The ABC language is discussed in the ABC note (see below).
# Test Sample Program
```
b = 2
c = 3
a = b + c
```
# Grammar
The file _abc.ohm_ contains the grammar
```
ABCgrok {
TopLevel = Assignment+

  Assignment =   Variable "=" Expression -- complex
               | Variable "=" number -- simple
  Expression = Variable "+" Variable

    Variable = "a" .. "z"
    number = dig+
    dig = "0" .. "9"
}
```
I have added an explicit digit rule (dig) instead of using the Ohm-JS library.
# Glue (aka action (aka semantics))
```
TopLevel [@assignments] = [[${console.log (assignments)}]]
Assignment_complex [v keq e] = [[var ${v} = ${e};\n]]
Assignment_simple [v keq n] = [[var ${v} = ${n};\n]]
Expression [v1 kplus v2] = [[${v1} + ${v2}]]
Variable [c] = [[${c}]]
number [digits] = [[${digits}]]
dig [c] = [[${c}]]
```
Each rule in the _glue_ specification corresponds to a rule in the grammar.

The left-hand-side parameters name each of the sub-matches in the grammar.

Parameters that correspond to iteration nodes in the grammar (`+`, `*`, `?`) are prefixed with an at symbol `@`.

The right-hand-side of each specification rule consists of JS _template strings_ enclosed in double-brackets `[[]]`.

_Glue_ also supports raw preamble code enclosed in double-braces `{{}}`, but this feature is not use in this example.
# Future
Ftranspile() should be a command that runs from the command line.

The syntax for glue was chosen arbitrarily for experimentation.  I intend to upgrade the syntax (using glue 0.1 as a preprocessor) but haven't gotten around to it yet.  Having glue run from the command line would allow creating glue pipelines with newer syntax (decommissioning 0.1 is unnecessary, using pipelines).

[_Aside: ftranspile() is a first step in creating a command-line version of glue._]

_Glue_ rules should return JS objects instead of returning only strings.
# To Run
To run this version, use the bash script

`./run.bash`

You should see the result

    var b = 2;
    var c = 3;
    var a = b + c;

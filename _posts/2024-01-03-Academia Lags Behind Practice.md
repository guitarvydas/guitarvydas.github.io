I would say that academic study just about always lags behind practice. 

For example, we still don't really know what "electricity" is, but, we use it every day.  

Academic analysis seems to come in 2 stages
1. quantify the relationships
2. explain the relationships.

Tesla and Edison worked out how to use Electricity in practice.

Steinmetz, Wheatstone, Maxwell, et. al. created equations that quantified *some* of the effects.

I don't know of any real explanation for what is going on at a deeper level (i.e. (2)).

Robert Distinti describes Electrical effects that haven't yet been quantified, e.g. self-induction.  And, he's working on an explanation of what's going on underneath.

Tesla probably figured out more about the explanation of electrical phenomena than he cared to share, or could put into words.

Historically, it has taken decades to leak academic Scientific study into Engineering.  Practice, then Science, then Engineering. We can do better.

title:  "Software Brainstorming"
---

In creative endeavours, the techniques of _brainstorming_ are used.

In software development (which is a creative endeavour), _brainstorming_ can be facilitated by:
- Scapple
- B-Rhymes.com and Rhymezone.com.

Scapple is a product that appears to be mind-mapping software, at first glance.  The UX of Scapple offers significantly less friction than that of most mind-mappers. Friction inhibits creativity.

B-Rhymes and Rhymezone are websites that provide rhyming dictionaries for English words. At first glance, one would conclude that rhymes have no place in software development, but,
- I argue that "finding the right word" is vital to expressing ideas, even software ideas.
- Rhyming dictionaries can be use as seeds for _brainstorming_[^pp], instead of just being used to find rhyming words.  Many songwriting workshops discuss _brainstorming_ techniques, but tend to overlook the usefulness of rhyming dictionaries in this regard.

[^pp]: I thank Pat Pattison for pointing this technique out to me.

title:  "PT Notes for Torlisp - PEG for Zodetrip"
---

# Goal

Use "#lang peg" to convert portions of Zodetrip.rkt.

[_Zodetrip was discussed in an earlier Torlisp meeting.  Zodetrip is a game jam entry written in racket, by Jos'h Fulller_]

# Progress

Small amounts of progress, not finished yet.

- Step 1: (done) chop zodetrip.rkt into separate files (modules)

- currently trying to determine is knowledge of racket macros will be necessary

- Step 2: (in progress) convert keying function to "#lang peg" (requires knowledge of how to emit _case_ from _peg_)

- fallout:

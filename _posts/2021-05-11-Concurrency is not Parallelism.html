<p class="p2">I used to conflate parallelism and concurrency until I watched Rob Pike’s talk.</p>
<p class="p2">I used to try to convince people that they could write concurrent programs using something “better” than Processes (Threads).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What I didn’t realize was that I was trying to explain the difference between the <span class="s1">paradigm</span> called “concurrency” and the application <span class="s1">problem</span> called “parallelism”.</p>
<p class="p2">A parallel program <i>must</i> run on multiple processors.</p>
<p class="p2">A program designed using the concurrent paradigm can run on a <i>single</i> Processor or on multiple processors. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">The advantages of using the concurrent paradigm can be seen even on a single processor system.</p>
<p class="p2">One can write concurrent software that uses only a single Processor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One cannot write parallel software that uses a single Processor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One can <i>simulate</i> parallel software on a single processor, but this is not necessary (although it might help debugging, while hindering debugging). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Multi-tasking – as we know it today – is a <i>simulation</i> of parallelism.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Multi-tasking, as we know it today, tries valiantly to solve too many problems at once – e.g. memory sharing, bandwidth optimization, time-sharing, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Multi-tasking as we know it today, is a simulation of parallelism that attempts to optimize concurrency using multiple stacks (a form of memory sharing optimization + processor optimization and sharing).</p>

<h2 style="margin: 24.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Helvetica"><b>Implementing the Concurrent Paradigm</b></h2>
<p class="p2">A concurrent system is composed of a number of <i>closures</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a single distinguished routine, called the Dispatcher().<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Distpacher() invokes closures, at random.</p>
<p class="p2">That’s all there is.</p>
<p class="p2">It is simple – almost too simple – to implement concurrency in any language that supports <i>closures</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is possible to implement the concurrent paradigm in C or assembler, too, one just needs to pay more attention to details.</p>
<p class="p2">As simple as this sounds, the concurrent paradigm forces one to program in a completely different manner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The program cannot rely on synchrony.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The program – composed of many communicating closures – must be written in a way that acknowledges that <i>any</i> closure might be awakened at <i>any </i>time (by the Dispatcher()).</p>
<p class="p2">This seemingly simple requirement causes programmers to re-evaluate control-flow coupling.</p>
<p class="p2">Operating system Processes and threading libraries are heavy-handed approaches to creating closures and a Dispatcher().<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some, <i>but not most</i>, cases it is necessary to use hardware to protect one program from another (e.g. MMUs).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some, <i>but not most</i>, cases it is necessary to optimize memory usage using memory-sharing and stacks (stacks are just an optimized form of linked lists).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some, <i>but not most</i>, cases it is necessary to use time-sharing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you strip these features out of threading libraries, you get multi-tasking that is easy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Closures have been around for a long time, and they don’t require MMUs, memory sharing, stacks and time-sharing.</p>
<p class="p2">Closures are like GOTOs – they <i>can</i> be misused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Organizing closures in a hierarchical manner (see my other essays on this subject) is one way to tame their use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have found that we need “languages” that encourage certain usage patterns – e.g. C vs. assembler programming (C encourages Structured control flow, through if-then-else statements, etc.) - e.g. OO encourages data encapsulation (but leaves control-flow encapsulation wide open, if not worse off).</p>
<p class="p2">GOTOs are assembler-level details.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>GOTOs must exist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>GOTOs must be tamed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Likewise, Closures exist and must be tamed.</p>
<p class="p2">Message-passing is another GOTO-like atomic element.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It must be tamed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Message-passing enables the concurrent paradigm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A component can send another component a message, but the receiving component is not constrained as to when it deals with the message.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Message-passing defeats rendezvous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Message-passing allows asynchrony.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The concurrent paradigm requires asynchrony.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p2">Backus asked “Can Programming Be Liberated From The von Neumann Style?”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The question is a good one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The answer that Backus proposed was insufficient, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mathematics, as we know it today, implies synchronous evaluation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need to think of mathematics and synchrony being <i>isolated</i> on asynchronous <i>islands</i>.</p>
<p class="p2">Computers are parallel by default.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Forcing synchrony onto every part of computing is contrary to the manner in which computers work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, multi-tasking is considered to be a “hard” problem mostly because multi-tasking is being solved using only one paradigm – a paradigm that is not the best choice for every problem in a particular solution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is like trying to emulate C-like <i>format</i> statements in PROLOG.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It can be done, but results in accidental complexity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">“Yes” to synchronous operations floating on asynchronous islands.</p>
<p class="p2">“No” to synchronous <i>everything</i>.</p>
<p class="p2">It is OK to use more than one paradigm at a time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, again, PROLOG leads the way towards thinking in relational terms, but casting <i>everything </i>as a relation brings unnecessary difficulty.</p>

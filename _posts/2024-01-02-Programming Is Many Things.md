*Programming* is many things.

A single person (group) *can* do all of the things, but, if you need to scale upwards from a cottage industry mindset, you need to find ways to cleave the work into separate parts, which can be done by other people / groups.

The essence is to provide a notation for communication between the parts, that allows each of the parts to concentrate on their goals
	- probably needs more than one "language" / notation (ex.  construction blueprints as opposed to CAD drawings of I-beam details)

# Possible Breakdown of Programming Into Separate Parts
- **SWArch** 
	- Architecture
	- Requirements gathering
	- sketching, storyboarding, roughing-in
- **SWEng**
	- Engineering
	- MVI - Minimum Viable Implementation
		- need to maintain provenance to original SWArch sketch
		- Engineer can use any technology, but, it needs to be known to work
- **SWImpl**
	- Implementation
	- MVI
	- subsequent iterations
- **SWProdEng** (Production Engineering)
	- Optimization
		- possible refactoring of MVI
		- need to maintain provenance to original Architectural sketch
- **SWMaint**
- **SWTesting**
	- white box
	- black box
	- regression
	- Q/A
- etc, etc.

The members of each group are allowed to communicate / negotiate with the other groups in an iterative manner. Yet, each group must concentrate on their set of goals.

# Appendix - TL;DR

(self-reference to this note, don't bother reading or following this reference if you're already reading this ...)

I believe strongly that SWArch, SWEng, SWImpl, SWProdEng, SWMaint, etc. are very distinct disciplines under the same umbrella called "programming".

A single person (group) *can* do all of the things involved in programming, but, if you need to scale upwards from a cottage industry mindset, you need to find ways to cleave the work into separate parts which can be done by other people / groups.

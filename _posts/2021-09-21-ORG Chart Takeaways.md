## ORG Charts
Business organizations are built in a scalable manner.

Business organizations are described by ORG Charts.

# Trees

ORG Charts are usually expressed as *trees*.

Managers at higher levels in the ORG Chart pass commands/requirements down to mid-level managers.  Mid-level managers pass commands/requirements down to lower-level managers and so on until the commands reach the bottom of the tree.

Mid-level managers "report" upwards to higher-level managers providing summaries of activities and eliding details.

In a smooth-running business, no manager - at any level - is swamped by detail.

# Breaking the Tree Structure

Businesses use the phrases "*micro-management*" and "*going over the boss's head*" to describe non-scalable violations of the organization's tree structure.

In software, we call these kinds of violations *dags* instead of *trees*.

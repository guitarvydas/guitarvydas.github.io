I've reached the conclusion that Global Variables are *not* bad (!). 

The underlying problem is visibility, i.e. can you see all of variables in one window, can you grok what the relationships are? 

Old BASIC programs didn't have this "problem" - until programmers started making huge BASIC programs that wouldn't fit onto one screen. 

FP prescribes lassoing all variables as parameters that can fit onto one window. There are other ways to contain this "problem", but, the FP cult wants you to believe that theirs is the *only* way.  

A different option: use layers that obey the Rule of 7, and do not allow inheritance so that when you look at a code in a window, you *know* that it won't ever change. Instead of inheritance, use Parental Authority (which I credit Harel for).

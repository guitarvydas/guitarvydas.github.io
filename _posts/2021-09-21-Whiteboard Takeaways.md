# Whiteboards

Many software designs start out life as drawings on a whiteboard.

# Tell

This is a *tell* that our programming notation should include whiteboard-level diagrams.

# Layered Details

Most whiteboard diagrams do not contain enough technical detail to be implemented using computer programs.

This is another *tell* that most people, e.g. CEOs, don't want to specify all of the details of a solution.

It is expected that Engineers will fill in the details.  That is what Engineers get paid to do.

# Engineers Don't Write Code

Engineers fill in the details for a design, but don't actually write code.

Code is written by Implementors, much in the same way that building Architects and building Engineers draw up blueprints and hand the blueprints off to Construction Workers for implementation.

## Functional Programming

Functional programming breaks down into two actions:

1. pattern matching
2. text replacement & manipulation

### Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is _parsing_.

Currently, the easiest parsing method is PEG.

My favorite variant of PEG is Ohm-JS.

Ohm-JS claims to simplify PEG parsing, through various complicated means (upper-case vs. lower-case rules).

The real gems in Ohm-JS are:

1. Separation of Concerns (grammar separated from semantics, unlike in other variants of PEG)

2. the Ohm-editor.

The Ohm-editor simplifies the act of building parsers.

If I were to use any other PEG library, I would use the Ohm-editor first.

### Text Manipulation

Functional programming, and mathematical notation, imposes the restriction that there can be no side-effects.

In fact, this is only a subset of the more important idea of _isolation_.

You can allow mutation, and, you can build components that are arbitrarily complex, _as long as the components are isolated_.

## Isolation
Isolation is more important than complexity.

Isolation is more important than immutability.

### Scalability
Isolation provides scalability.

### Black Boxes
Isolation means that you can treat  Components as black boxes - input & outputs, we can't care about what is inside.
## Everything Is A Fractal

Everything is a fractal.

Everything can be further sub-divided.

That includes everything I write.  Nothing I write is _absolute_, it is _relative_, and, it can be broken down.

  <li class="li1">I was taught about state machines in EE school, but, they said, you couldn't make practical use of SM's because of the "state explosion" problem (Fig. 20 of Harel's paper shows a very simple example of "state explosion").</li>
  <li class="li1">Harel's notation conquers the "state explosion" problem.</li>
  <li class="li1">Harel's notation then goes one step too far and winds concurrency into the notation ("orthogonal states").</li>
</ol>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">(2) is explicit - you draw lines (curvy arrows) to show transitions</p>
<p class="p3">(3) is implicit - you have to read the code to see who-depends-on-what.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Remove (3) and you have a wonderful notation that I call HSM's (Hierarchical State Machines).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Move (3) into its own notation and you get "network diagrams" (aka "box and arrow diagrams"), and the FBP-like stuff that I build (currently called "Arrowgrams", formerly known as "bmfbp" (for Bare Metal FBP)).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">(2) and (3) are, both, simple notations. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">When you try to combine the two notations, you get accidental complexity. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Harel wrote a follow-on paper about the micro-semantics of his notation and told us that everything must work in a lock-step manner. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Arrowgrams gives you concurrency in a simple form ("multitasking is easy" :-)). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">HSMs give you anti-state-explosion.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I built a full Harel Statechart textual language (some 8 passes, iirc), then backed off and simplified ((2) hierarchical state machines and (3) a message-passing kernel).<a id="fnlink1"></a><a href="#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">If you think in terms of communicating-state-machines, you brush up against Actors-like thinking.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">[<i>further: YACC dealt with the "state explosion" problem, too, but, over-specified (IMO) and didn't allow users to control the explosion handling in an explicit manner]</i></p>

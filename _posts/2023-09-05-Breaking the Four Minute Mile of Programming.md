#BreakingTheFour-MinuteMileOfProgramming

It was unimaginable that someone could run one mile in only four minutes.

Then, Roger Bannister ran one mile in under four minutes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-minute_mile

Once this feat became imaginable, many other runners have accomplished the same feat.

Today, it seems unimaginable that programming languages could use anything but text.

Is this only a memetic barrier?

Can we build a language based on DaS?  Diagrams as Syntax instead of text as syntax?

Can we build a new language in less than one day?

Can we use multiple special purpose languages instead of one general purpose language for projects?

Can we plug software components together like LEGO® blocks?

## SCNs - Special Purpose Programming Languages

- Solution Centric Notation
# Appendix - A Diagram Language - Drawware and DaS
- XML parsing
- GPT for diagram recognition?
	- restrict recognition to a small set of figures
		- arrows
		- rectangles
		- ellipses
		- grouping
		- text
		- other figures (rhombus, custom, etc.)

# Appendix - LEGO® Block Software Components
- what prevents us from plugging software components together?
	- https://guitarvydas.github.io/2020/12/25/The-ALGOL-Bottleneck.html
- need 0D

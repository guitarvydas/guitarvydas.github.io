## Uncomplicated PLs For Design
Design only needs two kinds of data:
- a thing
- a bunch[^bunch] of things.
Anything more is deliterious.

[^bunch]: Bunch is aka Collection.
[^pl]: PL means Programming Language.

## Tell: PLs That Are Too Complicated
Any language that _encourages_ you to use `+` or `array` or `cons` or `...` is too complex for most design applications. 

That kind of PL should only be used for `implementation`, not for design.

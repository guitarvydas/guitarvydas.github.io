Kill `make`.

Kill `npm`.

Kill package managers.

Kill libraries.

Kill synchrony.


## Goal - Zero Dependencies

Aim to write software that has zero (0) dependencies on other software.

If this is "hard" to do, demand better features from your language designers.

N.B. calling a function creates a hard-wired dependency.
1. The name of the function is (usually) hard-wired into the calling code.
2. The CALL is (usually) implemented using a global variable (The Stack).  Using an implicit stack creates a dynamic dependency chain.

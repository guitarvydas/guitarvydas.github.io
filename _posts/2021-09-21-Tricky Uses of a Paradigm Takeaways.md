## Tricky Uses of a Paradigm 

Tricky uses of a paradigm are a *tell* that something is wrong with the paradigm being used.

# Loops vs. Recursion

It has been discovered that Loops are a subset of Recursion.

Who cares?

Engineers and Implementors care.

Normal people don't care.

CEOs don't care.

Non-programmers don't care.

# Continuations

Continuations can be used to describe control-flow using the functional paradigm.

Who cares?

Normal people don't care.

# Thread Libraries

Thread libraries can be used to force-fit concurrency into the functional paradigm.

Who cares?

Normal people don't care.

Normal people use concurrency in their day-to-day lives (e.g. cooking recipes) without thinking about the details.

Architects need to capture concurrency requirements specified by "normal people" and need to translate such details into Engineering requirements.

# Layers

Ideally, there should not be a large gap between requirements specified by customers and details required at the Engineering levels.  

The flow of requirements from customers to Architects to Engineers to Implementors should contain a smooth flow of provenance (being able to track customer requirements to their Implementation details).

If the mapping from customer requirements to Implementation cannot be performed in one smooth step, then a series of steps - layers - should be used.

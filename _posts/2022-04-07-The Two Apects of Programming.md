title:  "The Two Aspects of Programming"
---
## What Is Programming?
Programming is the act of controlling machines.

## Programming Aspects
1. Match a pattern
2. Do something with the matches.

## IDEs For Programming

What we want are IDEs that make controlling machines easier.

Programming Languages are one (but one) kind of IDE for programming.

## GPLs - General Purpose Programming Languages

Ideally, we want an IDE for step (1) (patten matching) and a completely different IDE for step (2) (doing something).

Currently, we are stuck using the same IDE - GPLs[^gpl][^ex] - for both steps.

[^gpl]: GPL means General Purpose programming Language
[^ex]: Like C++, Python, Rust, Haskell, etc.

Worse, yet, we are forced to use grids of little bitmaps for all of our programming IDE needs.

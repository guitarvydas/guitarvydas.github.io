Actors are only the building-blocks of async programs.  

It is possible to build spaghetti-Architectures with Actors.

Similar to the suggestions in "GOTO Considered Harmful", one needs to find ways to structure Actor-based system designs.  

[Aside: people avoid message-based systems because early message-based systems were flat and tangled - something that a good wallop of structuring could fix].

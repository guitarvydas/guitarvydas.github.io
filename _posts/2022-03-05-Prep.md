## Elevator Pitch

Transpile source code into other source code.

## Synopsis

Transpile source code into other source code.

`Prep` works on blocks of text bracketed by REGEXPs, using PEG to transpile the blocks.

`Prep` is like `sed` but uses grammars instead of REGEX and uses `glue` instead of REGEX rewriting syntax.

## Github

https://github.com/guitarvydas/prep

See the `doc/` and `presentation/` subdirectories.  Most of the documentation has been done in markdown using Obsidian.

## Usage

I think that all you need is to have `prep` (a JS shebang script) on your path.

You need to `npm` install `Ohm-JS`, `atob`, `pako`, `yargs`. [I've probably missed some items - let me know].


## WIP

I believe in "showing my intermediate work".  This is WIP[^1], but, AFAICT[^2], it works and is usable.

## Contributing

I will gladly impart these ideas to anyone with an open mind - experience not necessary.

A macro like
```
#if xyz
...
#endf
```

might be represented as
![ifdiagram](/assets/if-box-if.png)

instead of as ASCII Art
```
#if xyz {
...
}
```

## Better Yet

![ifdiagram](/assets/if-box-if2.png)

## DaS

Diagrams As Syntax

Not a full-blown VPL, just 
- rects
- ellipses
- text
- lines.

SVG already supports the above.

ASCII was supported by mid-1900s hardware.

SVG is supported by 2000s hardware.

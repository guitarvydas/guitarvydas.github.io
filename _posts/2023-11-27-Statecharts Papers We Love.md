# Statecharts Papers We Love

My reading of the original Statecharts paper is [Statecharts Papers We Love, Toronto, Aug. 2019](https://youtu.be/-6VzMNoHhtU)

I presented this paper in August of 2019.  I've included the original slide deck from that presentation.  The voice-over for this YouTube was done afterwards.

# Appendix - Revelations and Opinions About Statecharts
???

My opinions on why I think that Statecharts are worth consideration are in a separate essay 

Harel's StateCharts offer wonderful insights intoÂ 
- diagrammatic programming
- isolation (encapsulation) of state
- isolation of control flow.

- DPLs are the first step towards VPLs
- Multiple Languages
- State Explosion Problem
- Parental Authority Instead of Inheritance
- What Is An Event?
- Communicating State Machines

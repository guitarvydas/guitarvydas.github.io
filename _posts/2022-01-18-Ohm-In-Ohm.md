title:  "Ohm in Ohm"
---
# Summary
I share a grammar for Ohm and a diagram to go with it.

# Make-Work
This grammar - ohm in Ohm - already exists in the source code for the Ohm-JS compiler.  For reasons not well understood, I backed into creating my own grammar from scratch.

# Diagram of the Grammar
In the process, I drew myself a diagram (using draw.io) which can be seen in the [SVG Diagram](https://github.com/guitarvydas/ohm-parse/blob/main/ohm-grammar.svg) and in the README of the [ohm-parse github](https://github.com/guitarvydas/ohm-parse).

# Diagram Notation for Grammars
I think that I found a consistent diagrammatic notation for all constructs in the grammar.

# Transpiler

I went on to build a transpiler using this grammar.  

I used my *glue*[^2] DSL for the transpiler.

# Testing
### Identity Transform
I began by creating an [identity transformation](https://github.com/guitarvydas/ohm-parse/blob/main/identity-ohm.glue) which sanity-checks the glue file by outputting the input after parsing it (a big fat no-op, but satisfying nonetheless).

### Grammar Checking

Sanity-checking the grammar was done using the [Ohm editor](https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/) and various test samples, culminating in testing the whole of the grammar on itself.

# Disclaimer
This stuff is dripping fresh and probably contains errors, but, I hope that it will be of use to someone in understanding how to create a grammar (or, at least, understanding how I do it).

# Future
I intend to use this grammar to do *some* of my editing work for me - just enough to trade off the development time against the boring task of typing a *glue* specification for another project.

The beginnings of this partial-editor can be seen in [emitglue.ohm](https://github.com/guitarvydas/ohm-parse/blob/main/emitglue.ohm) and [emitglue.glue](https://github.com/guitarvydas/ohm-parse/blob/main/emitglue.glue).

I don't intend to make the partial-editor complete.  I will stop working on it when I think that editing the result manually will take less time that tweaking emitglue.glue.

## Cannot Use Sed and Awk and REGEXs
Normally, I would use `sed` or `awk` or regular expressions to hack code for me, but, in this case, I needed to match structured blobs of code that would be best done with something better than REGEX, i.e. by using a parser.

## Prep
I intend to use my `prep` [^3] tool in combination with the .ohm and .glue files to give me a command-line code hacking utility.

`Prep` uses Ohm-JS to parse text code from stdin and uses `glue`  to reformat the text code.

`Prep` is also dripping fresh, but, is based on experience with previous tools like `pfr`.

# End User Programming In Pictures
## The Chasm


![Chasm Between End-User Programming and Formalization](/assets/end-user-programming-Chasm.png)

End users will *never* use the same language as used for formalization.

## The Reality

![Reality of End-User Programming vs. Details](/assets/end-user-programming-Reality-End-User-Programming.png)

End-users (and visionaries, e.g. CEOs), do not want to specify *all* of the details.

That is what they hire Engineers for.

## Engineering

Architects figure out the end-users' requirements.

Engineers figure out the details for implementation.

Implementors write the code.

(Note the similarity to other professions, like Construction).

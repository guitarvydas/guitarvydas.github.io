Fundamental observation: the ground rules have changed, but, we continue to use the same-old-same-old approach. 

In 1950, CPUs were ridiculously expensive and memory was scarce. 

In 2024, CPUs are ridiculously cheap (rPI, Arduino, etc.) and memory is wildly abundant. 

We *can* go back to the original model for concurrency - one thread per CPU - but, we continue using 1950-think.  

CPUs are just ICs made for sequencing and mutation.  

This is the new version of "The Gods Must Be Crazy" (CPU == Coke bottle).

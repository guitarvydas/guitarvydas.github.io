# GOTO

First Class Functions are GOTOs.

CPS - Continuation Passing Style - is GOTOs on steroids.

GOTOs first appeared in Assembly language.

CPS was borne out of /CC functions in Scheme.

# Utility

First Class functions & CPS are very useful in Denotational Semantics (to express control-flow).

Otherwise, 1st class functions and CPS should not be used in lieue of more structured expressions of control flow.  What are these more structured versions?  [GOTO Statement Considered Harmful](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_To_Considered_Harmful.html) might provide clues.

Current usage of 1st class functions is Structured only because of the severe restrictions imposed by FP - one-in, one-out[^exceptions] model of computing (aka "synchronous calculator").

[^exceptions]: Exceptions are but warts, bags on the side of one-in/one-out syntax. 

# Lambdas

Lambdas first appeared in Lisp (approx. 1956) based on lambda calculus.

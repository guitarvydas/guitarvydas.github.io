## The Problem With General Purpose Programming Languages
The idea of GPLs (General Purpose programming Languages) was developed when it was believed that the act of building languages was time consuming and difficult and a black art.

This assumption is no longer true (due to the advent of PEG technologies, and decades of research).

Yet, we continue down the path of inventing new kinds of GPLs at the exclusion of inventing ways to bolt disparate languages together to build solutions to problems.

GPLs are but wishy-washy unions of features needed to solve certain problems perceived by the inventor(s) of specific GPLs.  New GPLs are invented frequently (daily, weekly?), yet, all GPLs are based on the same-old, same-old features:
1. GPLs are all sequential (like assembler)
2. GPLs are based on the ideas of functions
3. GPLs assume that everything can - and should - be synchronized.

Haskell and Elm employ pattern matching.

Parsing _is_ pattern matching.

PEG is my favourite parsing tool, A.T.M.

Ohm-JS is my favourite PEG A.T.M.

## DSLs for Pattern Matching

REGEX is a DSL for line-oriented pattern matching.

PEG is a DSL for structure-oriented pattern matching.

## Fractalizing FP

Haskell (and Elm, etc.) could be decomposed into two components:

1. parsing
2. the rest

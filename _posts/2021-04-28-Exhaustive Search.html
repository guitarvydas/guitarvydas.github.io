<h1 id="exhaustivesearch">Exhaustive Search</h1>

<p>We should do exhaustive search everywhere. I suggest using PROLOG (swipl) and Kanren in stunted form - triples only, exhaustive search of triples. I have ported PROLOG (the good parts) to JS using Ohm-JS (from Scheme) and it would take only an afternoon or so to change the text emitter to emit just about any other language (e.g. Python, Haskell, etc.).</p>

<p>Note that exhaustive search enables relational. Relational enables Haskell et al.</p>

<p>Note that diagrams enable the breakdown of Software Development into Architecting, Engineering, Implementation, Testing, etc.</p>

<p>I change my mind and have new revelations daily. I have refined what I said a year ago.</p>

## Divide-and-conquer:
One view of programming:
1. Rigor, correctness, self-consistency
2. UX

Extremes:
- A
	1. 100% Rigor, correctness, self-consistency
	2. 0%    UX

- B
	1. 0%      Rigor, correctness, self-consistency
	2. 100% UX

Example: Lambda Calculus falls mostly into class A.
Example: Spreadsheets fall mostly into class B.

Neither, A nor B, is "better".  It depends on the problem that you are trying to solve.

title:  "Dynamic Binding vs. Static Binding"
---

Late binding = dynamic typing.  

Typing done at runtime.  Repeatedly.

Dynamic typing is often confused with No Typing.  Not the same.

Compiling is Production Engineering (which Kay mistakenly calls Software Engineering[^eng]).

[^eng]: Engineering is more nuanced than just *optimization*.  First, comes figuring *what* all of the details are, then, comes *optimizing* those details.  Architects think about details, too, but, different details (like "how does this fit in the eco-system?" (sometimes AKA "UX")).

Pour your Smarties out on the desk and sort them.  Red ones over here, green ones over there, …

If you can sort programming constructs like Smarties, you can pre-compile some of them and avoid doing them repeatedly at runtime.

Design ≡ being able to change your mind rapidly ≡ dynamic typing.

If you can sort programming constructs like Smarties, you can catch stupid mistakes earlier.

If you rely on static typing *only*, you inhibit Design.

Static binding says that variable names are inconsequential.

In the extreme - all syntax is inconsequential.

Syntax is just a *skin* draped over loftier concepts like paradigms.

[Delay, using long-running processes, and an example of debugging](https://github.com/guitarvydas/delay0d)

- The idea of "long-running" computations is hard-wired into the mindset of existing languages (loop, for, recursion, ...). If you can break that mindset, new ideas emerge. This example shows that you can re-use existing code done in the "old mindset" if you simply want an MVI (Minimum Viable Implementation - skimping on efficiency instead of skimping on product ideas)
- The single stack backtrace mindset no longer fits the needs of "debugging". Essentially you need a tree of backtraces. This example shows how to use "probes" to debug quickly without using any backtraces at all.

<p>[<em>Why not use TXL instead of Ohm?</em>]</p>

<p>Good question. I didn&#8217;t explicitly understand the problem until later, when I had PEG and JavaScript in my hands.</p>

<p>S/SL laid the groundwork for my understanding. It took only 30 more years. [<em>I used S/SL right from the beginning, but it took me a while to verbalize why I found it so useful.</em>]</p>

<p>I wonder if Cordy &#8220;got it&#8221; much earlier?</p>

<p>TXL is based on parse trees. Ohm-JS is based on JS objects. It became easier to program when I thought of objects instead of parse trees.</p>

<p>TXL looks like &#8220;compiler technology&#8221;. Ohm-JS <em>can</em> look like lowly JS. Maybe that makes Ohm-JS <em>feel</em> more accessible?</p>

<p>Paul Morrison talks about &#8220;steam engine time&#8221; - multiple inventions of the same concept, at about the same time.</p>

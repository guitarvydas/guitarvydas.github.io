# Inspiration for 0D

In this subsection, we delve into two fundamental sources of inspiration in the world of technology: electrical engineering principles and Moore's Law. These concepts shed light on the differences between hardware and software development.

## Electrical Engineering (EE)
- *Asynchronous Hardware:* EE designs often embrace asynchronous communication by default. Surprisingly, this doesn't lead to significant design difficulties in hardware systems.
- *Robust Hardware:* Hardware designs are meticulously crafted to ensure 0 failures in the field, a stark contrast to software development where field failures are more common.

## Moore's Law
- *Hardware's Ever-Expanding Horizons:* Moore's Law, a driving force for hardware, has continuously delivered rapid progress in chip performance and capabilities.
- *Software's Unique Challenges:* In contrast, there is no equivalent to Moore's Law for software, which begs the question: why has software development not witnessed similar exponential growth?

## inspiration
- EE
    - all ICs are asynchronous by default
        - async default does not cause design difficulties in HW
    - it is possible to design and debug a circuit design, then expect 0 failures in the field
        - in SW, though, there are always failures in the field
            - software designs are not as *robust* as hardware desi
                - why?
- Moore's Law
    - Moore's Law for hardware
    - no Moore's Law for software
        - why?

title:  "Software Atoms"
---
This is WIP.  

I am "thinking aloud" about the primitive elements of software.

I expect that the contents of this note will change with feedback and further thought.

I do, though, believe in "showing my work".  Showing intermediate results, no matter how rough.

Although this article is fresh, these ideas have been percolating for several decades, influenced by my experiences in running a small software consultancy.

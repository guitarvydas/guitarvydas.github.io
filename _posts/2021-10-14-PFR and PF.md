title:  "PFR and PF (Parsing Find and Replace)"
---
# Overview
<u>PFR</u> is a command-line find-and-replace utility that uses PEG parsing instead of REGEXP.  <u>PFR</u> outputs the resulting (modified input) file to stdout.

<u>PF</u> is a command-line find utility that uses PEG parsing instead of REGEXP (like GREP, except with parsing). <u>PF</u> merely prints the names of the matching files on stdout.

# Usage
```
pfr source-filename grammar-filename action-filename
pf source-filename grammar-filename
```

The 3 files contain text.  

*Source-filename* refers to a file which contains arbitrary text which is to-be-parsed.

*Grammar-filename* refers to a file which contains a grammar specification in *Ohm-JS* format.

*Action-filename* refers to a file which contains an action specification in *Glue* format.

# Code

PFR and PF are shell scripts (Bash) contained in that directory.  Put them on your PATH.

# Appendix - Ohm-JS Format

See [Ohm-JS Syntax](https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md).

# Appendix - Glue Format

# Future

These commands should deal with *stdin*, *stdout* and *stderr* in the usual UNIXÂ® style.  Instead, these commands currenctly require filenames on the command line.

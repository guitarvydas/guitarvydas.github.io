title:  "PFR and PF (Parsing Find and Replace)"
---
# Overview
<u>PFR</u> is a command-line find-and-replace utility that uses PEG parsing instead of REGEXP.  <u>PFR</u> outputs the resulting (modified input) file to stdout.

<u>PF</u> is a command-line find utility that uses PEG parsing instead of REGEXP (like GREP, except with parsing). <u>PF</u> merely prints the names of the matching files on stdout.

# Usage
```
pfr source-filename grammar-filename action-filename
pf source-filename grammar-filename
```

The 3 files contain text.  

*Source-filename* refers to a file which contains arbitrary text which is to-be-parsed.

*Grammar-filename* refers to a file which contains a grammar specification in *Ohm-JS* format.

*Action-filename* refers to a file which contains an action specification in *Glue* format.

# Code

[github](https://github.com/guitarvydas/parse)

PFR and PF are shell scripts (Bash) contained in that directory.  Put them on your PATH.

# Workflow

[*This section doesn't belong in the final PFR/PF man page, but the tools are young...*]

A workflow that works best for me is:

1. Use the [Ohm-Editor](https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/) to build and debug the grammar

2. Write a "vanilla" action spec that simply outputs what is input ("identity") ; note that if you use *syntactic rules* instead of *lexical rules* in the grammar, the output will omit spacing (that's OK, you just need to be aware of this ; the only way to get a pure identity grammar is to use syntactic rules only (not necessary))

3. Modify the *identity* action spec to suit your needs.

# Appendix - Glue Format

See [Glue Manual](https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/03/24/Glue-Manual.html).

See [Glue Overview](https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/04/11/Glue-Tool.html).

# Appendix - Sample Grammars and Actions

[ABC Glue](https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/09/15/ABC-Glue.html) (uses the `ftranpile()` function - a precursor to `PFR` - with a simple`.ohm` file and a simple `.glue` file (action spec))

[first class comments](https://github.com/guitarvydas/firstclasscomments) (this project was a quickie - one weekend - entry in the language jam ; the current versions of `sequence.js` and `details.js` contain the pre-cursor of `PFR` ; each of these contains references to multiple `.ohm` files and to multiple `.glue` files (action specs))

# Future

These commands should deal with *stdin*, *stdout* and *stderr* in the usual UNIXÂ® style.  Instead, these commands currenctly require filenames on the command line.

# DaS Workbench

DaS means "Diagrams as Syntax".

This essay gives a brief overview to a simplistic tool called `daswb`.

The interesting bits of this tool are the various phases.  

The HTML surrounding the phases is very rudimentary allowing discussion of the phases without interference from UX details.

# API

The DasWB inputs a .drawio file and outputs a factbase in PROLOG format.  

# Requirements

Download `ohm.min.js` and

# Other Fields

A number of yellow-ish input fields have been retained to allow easier copying and discussion below.

# Files

The DasWB uses Ohm-JS and various JavaScript functions found in various JavaScript files

- `support.js` contains utility functions used by the workbench
- `glue.js` contains the raw JS code for the Glue tool used by the workbench in conjunction with Ohm-JS
- `scope.js` contains a simplistic scope stack class used by glue code
- `ohm.min.js` is the JavaScript code for Ohm-JS (a PEG parser)
- `pako_inflate.js` is the JavaScript code for pako inflate

# Empty DasWB

Open a browser and load the File "daswb.html".

The empty workbench shows a number of fields and one button (scroll down to the bottom).

The yellow-ish fields are inputs to the workbench.

The gray-ish fields are outputs generated by the workbench.

We only need to populate one field - the `source` field with a raw .drawio file.

The other input fields (yellow-ish) are meant for grammar debugging and for the discussion below.

# DaSWB Populated with a Drawio File

We created the file `final.drawio`.  It looks like:

Copy/paste final.drawio into the `source` field of the workbench.

# DasWB Generated Code

Scroll to the bottom and push the `generate` button.

The factbase is generated and sorted into the final field `sorted factbase`.

The steps for this process will be discussed in subsequent essays.

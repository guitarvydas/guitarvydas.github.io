## Transpiler
"Compiler" that transpiles a Scheme project to JavaScript.

`doc/Start Here.md` and `doc/*.md` document a snapshot of the current diagrams and code that make up the transpiler written in drawware / 0D.  Includes commentary on warts and wish-list.

At this moment, I am writing a line-by-line description of RWR (the ReWRiter tool).

Includes ideas about:
- front end processing, towards RT (recursive text)
	- virtual commas (improved upon in Find-and-Replace by tokenization)
	- escaping whitespace
	- unquoting
	- list constants
- converting to JavaScript
	- 4 successive stages of transpiling
		- rewriting single characters
		- rewriting symbols
		- emitting expression statements as JavaScript
		- emitting list syntax as JavaScript
	- macros for JavaScript
	- cleanup
- utilities
- faking lisp functions in JavaScript
- RWR
	- a simple DSL that is used to accompany OhmJS and avoids manual writing of JavaScript for OhmJS
- ABC
	- an ultra-simple "language" to demonstrate the basics of OhmJS
	- interpreter basics
	- compiler basics

Includes odin0D (`0d/*.odin`), but, the latest version of odin0d is in the `find and replace` repo listed below.

## Find and Replace
https://github.com/guitarvydas/find-and-replace

A proposed markdown syntax for a macro that adds a find-and-replace skin for use in other languages, like Python, JavaScript, Rust, Odin, etc.

Written in diagrammatic form - drawware/0D.

Shows parsing of markdown & HTML as a programming language.

Contains the latest version of odin0d (`0d/*.odin`)
- augments Messages with provenance trails (*cause*)
	- includes a short essay 2023-10-15 Examining Dynamic Structure.md
- Datum
	- splits apart *data operands* from *control flow*
	- a *datum* is defined as a simple struct containing 4 fields
		- `data`
		- `clone()`
		- `reclaim()`
		- `asString()`

Contains the evolution of *virtual commas* into "*Delineate Words*"

The code runs from the diagrams.  Not as complete nor as documented-in-detail-as-text as the *transpiler* repo.  Ask me - I would be glad to explain.  Maybe questions will lead me towards targeting better documentation.

[N.B. It can be argued that textual documentation is not actually needed, since a picture is worth a thousand words :-]

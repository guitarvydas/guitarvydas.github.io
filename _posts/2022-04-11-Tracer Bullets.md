title:  "Tracer Bullets"
---

When debugging a concurrent app - one with many possible paths of execution - one wants the equivalent of *tracer bullets* to see where messages have gone, and, come-from.

A single backtrace is not enough.

## Implementation

Tracer bullets are straight-forward to implement in Common Lisp and JavaScript.

Tack the previous message onto the end of the current message (recursively, each message contains a trace of messages that caused them).

I'm experimenting with a `Message` class that has two main fields and two trace fields:
1. tag
2. data
3. come-from id
4. previous message.

Since each message is defined as above, `previous message` becomes a nested list from the beginning of time.

Currently, I output traces in Lisp syntax and use a Lisp pretty printer to view them (emacs *indent-region* in my case).

Fields (1) and (2) are *real*.  Fields (3) and (4) are for debugging.

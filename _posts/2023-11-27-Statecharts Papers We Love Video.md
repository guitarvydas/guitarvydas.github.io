# Statecharts Papers We Love Video

My reading of the original Statecharts paper is [Statecharts Papers We Love, Toronto, Aug. 2019](https://youtu.be/-6VzMNoHhtU)

I presented this paper in August of 2019.  I've included the original slide deck from that presentation.  The voice-over for this YouTube was done afterwards.
# Slide Deck

# Appendix - How Was This Video Made?
I created the full slide deck in Keynote (Apple's version of Powerpoint), then culled it and used it for the live, in-person one-hour presentation.

I recorded an audio voice-over on my laptop, in lieu of having a full video/audio of the original presentation.  

I posted the audio to SoundCloud, and, the slide deck(s) as a PDF to neocities.

More recently, I used Descript to glue the slides and audio together into a single video.  I used the "uh" deletion feature of Descript, then its A.I. overdub feature to smooth over various audio jump cuts and some of my pondering style of off-the-cuff speaking, including some long, drawn-out words and phrases.

I used Descript's "Studio Sound" feature to remove background hiss and to make it sound like I was in a sound-booth.

I added 20% reverb and an EQ notch at around 1KHz.

I, first, added a tiny bit of compression, but removed it, allowing Studio Sound to do its magic unfettered. Likewise, I removed "Low Shelf EQ".

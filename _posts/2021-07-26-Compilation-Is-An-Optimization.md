title:  "Compilation Is An Optimization"
---

Compilation is the process of removing information from a program before running it, in the hopes that the final program will run more efficiently (in terms of speed or in terms of size, or _something else_).

Compilation pre-checks certain conditions in a program, then removes the need to check those same conditions when the program is executed.

It is not easy to twist a language to make it compilable, but, compilation is but an optimization.

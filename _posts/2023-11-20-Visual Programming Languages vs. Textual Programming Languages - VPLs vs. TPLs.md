I see `c = sqrt(a * a + b * b)` as an "equation" and "equations" *should* be written in textual form (TPL - textual programming language).  

Writing "equations", though, is but a subset of the activity of "commanding electronic machines".  

VPLs should *not* be used to simply reformat equations (a mark of a VPL newbie, IMO).  

VPLs should be used to express things that written equations make difficult, e.g. concurrency, control-flow, time-based sequencing.  You *can* write this stuff in equation form, but, you have to stretch equation-based notations out of shape to do so, i.e. try explaining Monads to JavaScript programmers or CEOs.  

IMO, the ideal VPL is a *hybrid* that uses *text* for expressing equations and *visualizations* for expressing other kinds of things.

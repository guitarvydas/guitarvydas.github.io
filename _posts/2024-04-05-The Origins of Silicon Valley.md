I attended this talk https://events.vtools.ieee.org/m/409693 in-person, yesterday.

My main takeaway was that the companies in Silicon Valley shared knowledge with each other, whereas much larger companies on the east coast did not share information.

In Silicon Valley, "non-compete clauses" were not allowed.  This allowed people to move around freely, to accept employment in new ventures and to quickly form new ventures.

Only 5 states in the U.S. and, only recently, the province of Ontario (Canada) have legislation that disallows or doesn't honour non-compete clauses.

In my mind, this brings up the issue of "open source software" and how it relates to this concept.

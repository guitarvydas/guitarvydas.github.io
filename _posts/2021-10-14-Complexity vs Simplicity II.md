title:  "Complexity vs Simplicity II"
---

# Definition of Simplicity
"Lack of Nuance"
# Source of Complexity
Problems have a number of degrees of freedom - dimensions.

Our reality appears to have 4 dimensions (4D) - x,y,z,t.

Trying to squeeze more than one dimension into a single notation results in what we perceive as complexity.

Flattening 4D (reality) down to 2D (pen and paper) results in "complexity" - some things become merely harder to express. We need more than one 2D notation to express 4D concepts, each in a seemingly "simple" way.

# Complexity Is In The Eye Of The Beholder
Nothing is "complex".

The use of a mis-fitting notation might make a problem appear more complex, but does not change the underlying nature of the problem.

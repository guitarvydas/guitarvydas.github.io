# Diagram

Ports can be connected to one another. 

[_Only ports can be connected._]

Connections are shown as arrows.

Connections appear in the factbase as 3 facts:

1. A declaration, e.g. `edge(e,'').`
2. A source port, e.g. `source(e,a).`
3. A target port, e.g. `target(e,c).`

# Processing Connections

Edges as defined above need no further processing.

Later, we will tie edges to ports to components.

Drawio produces `edge` facts as `mxCell` nodes of the graph.  We don't need to do much more at this point.

title:  "Simplicity Is Hard"

# Simplicity Is Hard #

We have a zillion techniques for programming.

# Complex Techniques #

- Operating System - glorified libraries, include time-sharing and memory sharing in every app
- Synchronous
- Python, JS, Perl, etc.
- Mathematical Notation - rules for textual substitution - developed with text (when pen-and-paper was the only choice) - continue, blindly, with text
- Compile Time vs. Run Time fallacy
- two syntaxes for every language

# What is the ATOM of Software?

Trying to answer this question is one of my goals.

Currently, I think that _triples_ are The Atom.

Currently, I think that _relations_ (relation x subject x object) are the most succinct form of triples.

Currently, I think that Curried functions are actually triples in disguise. (A function of one argument is a double waiting to be completed by applying it to an Object).

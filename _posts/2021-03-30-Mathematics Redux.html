<h1 id="twosubdivisionsofmathematics">Two Subdivisions of Mathematics</h1>

<p>Mathematics can be subdivided as:</p>

<ul>
<li>a notation</li>
<li>a body of experience (e.g. in using the notation).<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="mathematicalnotation">Mathematical Notation</h1>

<p>Mathematical notation can be subdivided as:</p>

<ol>
<li>expressing a problem in mathematical notation</li>
<li>manipulating the notation, reducing the expression of the problem.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pencilandpaper">Pencil and Paper</h2>

<p>Mathematical notation was invented for use with pencil and paper.</p>

<p>Mathematical notation is a 2D notation, not a 3D notation.</p>

<h2 id="timevariance">Time Variance</h2>

<p>Manipulation of mathematical notation works mostly because time-varying variables have been expunged from the notation (&#8220;side-effect free&#8221;).</p>

<p>Removing time variance from the notation is an approximation. It works only in domains where time is not a major factor.</p>

<p>[<em>Note that other approximations, like finite-element analysis, can give more accurate results in specific domains that have time variance.]</em></p>

<h1 id="complexity">Complexity</h1>

<p>A <em>layer</em> is only as complicated as one wishes to make it.</p>

<p>The complexity lies in the amount of detail required to express the inputs and outputs of the layer.</p>

<p>One can tune the complexity of each layer by using different notations and approximations in each layer, instead of trying to encompass <em>all</em> variables in a single layer.</p>

<p>Complexity is &#8220;in the eye of the beholder&#8221;. Mathematical notation appears complicated to some (most), but appears simple to those who have steeped themselves in the notation.</p>

<h2 id="whoistheaudience">Who is the Audience?</h2>

<p>Regarding mathematical notation, an interesting question to ask is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is the Intended Reader?</li>
</ul>

<p>Is the notation meant to be used as communication between two mathematicians, or, between a mathematician and a non-mathematician (lawyer, graphics designer, construction worker, etc.)?</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<p>Complexity comes from trying to address too many details at any one layer of a design.</p>

<p>Successful complexity-management is the art of finding a group of inter-related details and relegating them to a layer.</p>

<h1 id="engineering">Engineering</h1>

<p>Engineers map notation from one domain into another.</p>

<p>For example, in construction, Engineers use mathematics (from the Architects, from textbooks, etc.) and produce blueprints that are understood by construction workers.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Engineers filter out details.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Actually, this can be subdivided even further. There is experience in using the notation and there is experience in thinking about problems (which are then mapped to this notation). <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to body" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>One doesn't usually find Engineers performing actual construction work. Engineering is usually done before the construction begins. On&#8211;site Engineers oversee that the work follows the specifications. Engineers might alter the specifications to better match reality as work progresses. <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to body" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>

</ol>

Live Coding is also known as a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop).

The difference between mid-1900s REPLs and Live Coding is the output medium.

In the mid-1900s, we were constrained to using ASCII for output.

Today, we are allowed to use 2D graphics.

[We can represent 3D scenes on 2D graphics hardware].

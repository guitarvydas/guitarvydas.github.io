We perceive at least four (4) dimensions:
1. location in X
2. location in Y
3. location in Z
4. location in Time

(x,y,z,t).

This brings up the question, then, of "what is 3D?".

Does 3D describe`(x,y,z)`, or, does 3D describe `(x,y,t)`?

*Blender* says that 3D means `(x,y,z)`.

*Flash* says that 3D means `(x,y,t)`.  Note that *Flash* is now replaced by the newer *Wick* project. I guess that *.gif*s falls into this category, too.

In fact, 3D is just a subset of 4D.

How many subsets of 4D are there?

4! = 24, but, order doesn't matter. `(x,y,z,t)` is the same as `(x,y,t,z)` for our purposes.

The only thing that matters is which units are used to represent quantities in these dimensions.  There are only 2 different units:
1. spatial
2. temporal.

Hence, there are only 2! permutations that matter to us.

I suggest that we name each of these permutations differently, when discussing them, e.g.
- `3Ds` concerns 3D using only *spatial* coordinates, e.g. `(x,y,z)`
- `3Dt` concerns 3D using, both, *spatial* and *temporal* coordinates, e.g. `(x,y,t)`

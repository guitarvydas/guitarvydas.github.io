title:  "Programming: First Principles Thinking"
---

I have stumbled upon an article about "First Principles Thinking" https://fs.blog/first-principles/.

I wonder/believe whether "First Principles Thinking" describes at least part of my approach.  My writing seems to be "all over the place" - a collection of seemingly random observations. I think that I try to find the *atoms* of software, then try to re-synthesize the act of programming.

What I call *simplicity* and what I call *atoms of software* are strongly related. 

I don't think that there is *one* programming language nor *one* thread through all of this stuff.  The idea of atoms allows one to construct any number of molecules that address programming from many angles.  

One angle is never enough. 

"Fads" are created when someone professes one angle to be more important than a plethora of angles.

# Hierarchical Types

Typed data is a packet with information arranged in layers wrapped in onion skins.

Typing is a pipeline of filters that peels the information in a series of small steps.

Networking already does this.

Type-checking is (already) done like this. A type checker is an interpreter which peels a layer of information off from a program and passes the peeled program on to another interpreter (ultimately, the CPU, which is just another interpreter).

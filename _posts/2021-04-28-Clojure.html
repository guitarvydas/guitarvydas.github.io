<h1 id="clojure">Clojure</h1>

<p>[<em>What do you think of Clojure?</em>]</p>

<p>I like Lisp (and CL) because it is multi-paradigm. Clojure is single-paradigm (FP).</p>

<p>Again, I like languages that I can write code to write code in.</p>

<p>Most people want languages that are human-readable. But, that stunts growth in the field of programming - growth stops at what the language designer imagined.</p>

<p>PEG+Lisp is a powerful combination - multiple syntaxes built on top of HLL assembler (I use the phrase &#8220;toolbox language&#8221; to mean &#8220;HL assembler&#8221;). Syntaxes can be tuned to a specific problem instead of only what Guido van Rossum could imagine (something which doesn&#8217;t fit most problems).</p>

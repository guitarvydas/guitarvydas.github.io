# Restricting Interfaces
The big win in software repeatedly seems to be in restricting interfaces.

Assembler is a restricted API of what is possible using microcode.

APIs are restricted interfaces to applications.

Structured Programming is a way to restrict control flow.

OO (Object Oriented) is a way to restrict data structuring.

Global variables were tamed by scoping (restricting the interface to variables).

λ Calculus is a way to restrict interfaces to
1. functions
2. bound variables

(λ Calculus uses The Stack to create a dynamic chain of containers at runtime.  Closures are containers with very restricted interfaces (one group of data in, one group of data out)).

## Portability, Retargeting
Research on compilers in the mid-1970s resulted in things like:

- OCG - Orthogonal Code Generator (Cordy), which defined a small set of operations to divide-and-conquer the task of compilation
	- 1. compiler produces code for generic operations (like "a = b + c")
		- all data was allocated in a uniform manner ([data descriptors](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/24039.24051]))
		- normalization makes automation easier
		- *condition descriptors* were invented and look a lot like λ of 2 parameters (true and false branches, De Morgan's Laws could be used to manipulate *condition descriptors*)
	- 2. tree-walker produces real code for specific CPUs from the generic code

- RTL - Register Transfer Logic -  (Fraser Davidson Peephole optimizer)
	- used in GCC
	- defines a small set of operations
		- all data was assumed to be allocated in "registers" (fake, virtual)
		- all operations act on "registers"
		- peephole optimizer walks RTL code and produces real code for specific CPUs
		- I built such a peephole optimizer using just AWK (for my 8080 C compiler)

Now, we are dealing with lambda calculus, which defines a small set of operations
	- apply
	- abstraction
	- access bound slot
and, encodes all programs as a combination of these operations.

## Normalization
To reiterate, normalization makes automation easier.

Assembler is easy to compile, because it is normalized to triples
`MOV R0, R1`.

OCG, RTL, [Peter Lee's take on Denotational Semantics](https://www.amazon.ca/Realistic-Compiler-Generation-Peter-Lee/dp/0262121417) all use the same trick - *normalization* (restricting the interface).

*Normalization* makes *divide-and-conquer* easier.

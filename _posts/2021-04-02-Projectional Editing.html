<ul>
<li>Reduce all input to normal form.</li>
<li>Write rules against normal form. Rules &#8212;&gt; views.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="1.normalform">1. Normal Form</h1>

<p>I favour a normal form consisting of <em>triples</em>.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/03/16/Triples.html">https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/03/16/Triples.html</a></p>

<h1 id="2.rules">2. Rules</h1>

<p>You want to perform exhaustive search over <em>all</em> of the triples.</p>

<p>A <em>rule</em> is just a group of related searches.</p>

<p>Such searching can be done manually, using loops within loops.</p>

<p>Or, one could use a tool &#8212; a search engine &#8212; to do the searching. One such search engine is PROLOG. Another engine might be miniKanren.</p>

<p>PROLOG uses <em>backtracking</em> to perform exhaustive search.</p>

<p>PROLOG uses something called <em>logic</em> <em>variables</em> to hold the results of successful matches.</p>

<p>There might be more than one match that succeeds in satisfying all of the search constraints. In such cases, PROLOG re-binds the values of the <em>logic variables</em> and presents you, the programmer, with a set of consistent matches (as one set of bound <em>logic variables</em>).</p>

<p>MiniKanren, on the other hand, does not use the above method and keeps a running list of <em>all</em> possible matches, then presents you, the programmer, with a list of <em>all</em> matches that consistently solve the set of given match constraints.</p>

<h2 id="unification">Unification</h2>

<p>PROLOG uses an algorithm, called <em>unification</em>, to re-bind <em>logic variables</em>.</p>

<p>One set of bindings describes <em>one</em> solution to all of the match constraints.</p>

<p>In essence, PROLOG <em>clears</em> its <em>logic variables</em> before calculating another solution. In essence, PROLOG memorizes previous solutions and does not present already-seen solutions again.</p>

<p>[<em>Note, that this does not mean that duplicate solutions cannot be displayed &#8212; PROLOG remembers the route that it used to find a solution, if it finds a different route which results in the same set of bindings, PROLOG will be happy to show you that solution as a possibility (much to the chagrin of PROLOG newbies).</em>]</p>

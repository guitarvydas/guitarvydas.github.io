title:  "Mathematics vs. Physical Reality"

# Mathematics
Mathematics uses a simple notation.

Mathematics notation allows algebraic substition of notation.

To perform substitution, there can be no "side effects"

# Dimensions

Physical reality is 4D - x, y, z, time.

Mathematical notation is 2D - x, y.


# Mathematics Ignores Time
Mathematics ignores time.

This reduces the number of dimensions to 3: x, y, z.

# Mathematics Projection from 3D to 2D

# Mathematics Doesn't Lose Information
It simply re-casts the Z-dimension into extra functions.

E.g. A port is 
```
{shape, direction, location}
```
This is flattened to {maybePort() x {direction, location}}.

# Diagrams on Tabs
Imagine a set of diagrams in a tabbed diagram editor.

Tabs go left-to-right (or right-to-left). X,Y

Tabs do not go "in" and "out". Z

Slideshow can show development of the diagram over time. T

# A Diagram is 2D.

# A Diagram With Hyperlinks is 3D

# A Slideshow Of A Diagrams With Hyperlinks == (3+1)D
## A Slideshow of Diagrams With Hyperlinks is 4D
- One diagram = X,Y = 2D
- Hyperlinks = Z
- Slideshow = T
- X,Y,Z,T = 4D

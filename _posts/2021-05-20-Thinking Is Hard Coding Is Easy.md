# Thinking is Hard, Coding is Easy

The hard part of programming is the thinking part.

Coding is easy.

Coding is easy when you know what to code.

Ideally, a program should consist of one line of code.

I've never achieved this ideal[^apl], but I have written whole solutions in about one page of code.

I concentrate on the thinking, and de-emphasize the coding.

[^apl]: I came close to describing a complete solution in one line of code when in APL, but that was one very complicated line of code.

LLMs will be democratized when Apple releases the Apple Silicon M99 chip with 100,000 cores in a machine for about $549.  At the moment, M2 provides only a measly 16 neural cores.  

Perhaps a Galilean inversion of Ptolemaic Software Cosmology will be required? 

Galilean Software Cosmology: The Universe does not revolve around a solitary CPU chip, but, is composed of zillions of CPU chips.  

In the 1950s, it was believed that The CPU was the center of the Universe - i.e. Ptolemaic Software Cosmology. 

In 2023, the ground rules have fundamentally changed.  Programmers have bowls full of $1 CPUs and essentially-infinite amounts of memory. 

For example, VISA gave me - for free - a plastic card with an embedded CPU plus local persistent memory. It doesn't even need batteries.  

For a further example, every person carries around super-computers in their pockets these days, each being connected to zillions of other super-computers via cellular networks.

The problem is no longer "how to make a single CPU run faster", but, has become "how to make a network of zillions of nodes more manageable and to run faster and to be cheaper".  Ptolemaic Software Cosmology is unsuited to dealing with such (new) problems.

I've moved my writing to (free) Substack https://programmingsimplicity.substack.com.

Thus far (2024-06-28), I've published short essays entitled:

- Smallness
- Connections are Triples
- Not Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants
- Failure Driven Development
- Ceptre Overview
- Complexity Elision Pyramid
- Programming Baggage
- Exploring Technique and Notations for Augmenting DX
- Routing 101 Part 1
- Structured Message Passing
- Asynchrony - Little Networks

Substack writing is easily readable on small phones and allows comments.

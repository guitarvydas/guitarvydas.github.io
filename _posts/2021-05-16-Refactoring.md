title:  "Refactoring"

Refactoring is accidental complexity.

Accidental complexity is also known as "epicycles"[^1].

[^1]: See Copernican vs. Ptolemaic Cosmology.  See Arthur Koestler's "The Sleepwalkers".

The need to refactor a design or to refactor code, should be a red flag. 

Refactoring should never be needed in a design which has been decomposed into its most-atomic units.  

Refactoring is accidental complexity caused by too much structure in a design.  

Structure can be added in by creating queries.

Structure should not be baked into a factbase. 

[Structure in queries is OK, structure in factbases is bad].

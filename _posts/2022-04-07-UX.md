Spreadsheets are good UX for accountants.  Lambda Calculus is lousy UX for accountants.

Lambda Calculus is good UX for lanuage theorists.  Spreadsheets are lousy UX for language theorists.

## Programmer UX

We don’t worry about programmer-UX enough and remained mired in the biases of the mid-1900s.

Programmers get only to use grids of non-overlapping small bitmaps (characters, lines of text).

We design modern (2000’s) UXs for accountants, and CEOs and other computer users, but, not for programmers.

## Example
[Is this good UX For Programmers?](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/2d-an-exploration-of-drawing-as-programming-language-featuring-ideas-from-lambda-calculus/overview/)

[*The answer depends on what the programmers are trying to accomplish. Are they trying to manipulate theoretical concepts of textual notations, are they trying to manipulate websites, or, ...?*]

Electronics designers do not use chip-layout-CAD for all designs.  They don't bother to design circuits using diagrams of molecules and atoms, even though they, ultimately, work with chemical compounds (e.g. oxides).

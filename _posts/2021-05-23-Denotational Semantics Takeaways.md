title:  "Denotational Semantics Takeaways"
---
# Takeaways
- abstractions for describing control flow

# Anti-Takeaways
Describing everything in a flat manner leads to complexity.

_All-in-one_ leads to accidental complexity. E.G. CPS is useful in Denotational Semantics, but is horrible for maintenance of "normal" applications that don't need to create new kinds of control-flows.

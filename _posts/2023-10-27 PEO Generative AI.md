## Introduction

I went to a PEO talk on October 24, 2023.  The speaker discussed Generative AI.  I found the talk to be very enlightening.  
  
Below is my understanding / summary:

## Summary

AI is simply pattern-matching.

An early LLM was Eliza.  LLM AI has been around since, at least, 1964.

AI classifies patterns through training, then uses the classifications to predict what is next in a given sequence.

Improvement: in 1964, Weizenbaum hard-coded patterns into the Eliza program. Today, "training" creates the patterns automatically.  And, the training corpus is huge (the whole internet).

AI does not have self-awareness.

AI cannot possibly "take over the world" because it does not have self-awareness.

title:  "markdown for design and implementation (WIP)"
---

# Overview

- use .md to describe design, user another .md to describe implementation (multiple views)

- add `@` syntax to create and ref other .md files
- implementation is *bash* or *python* or *whatever*
- observation: 
  - disease: trying to fit everything onto one notation
  - cure: use multiple views and multiple notations, all very similar to .md and to *bash*
- diagram: 
  - only one way to view a design/implementation
  - currently using *drawio* https://www.diagrams.net
- text:
  - only one way to view a design/implementation
  - *bash* is textual
  - *python* is textual
  - *JavaScript* is textual
  - .md is textual
- asynchronous
  - all components are asynchronous 
  - all components are concurrent (*can* be run in parallel, but not necessarily)
    - note that all *parallel* designs are subsets of *concurrent* designs
    - parallelism is an implementation detail
    - concurrency is a design paradigm, though

# Refinement

The "most interesting" question is: "what happens to my original idea(s) when I refine the idea(s)"

[This also applies to TODOs - how do you refine/embellish a TODO item?].

For example, I have an item and I begin to envision doing it in two steps.

Do I re-write the item, or, do I "push into" the item (open a new file, zoom in on a diagram element, etc.)?

How does the editor "remember" what was there and how does it represent the newer version?

This step is *recursive*.  Once I've broken an item down into two parts, what happens if I want to break down one of the parts into two more parts? And so on...

# Edit operations

- add node
- connect node
- ref to other .md file
- butted rectangles means sequence (synch)
- SVG rect, ellipse, text, line
- line beginning with `@` means other-file with given name (includes spaces) e.g. `@ all containment` means other-file called `all containment.md`
- rename `@`node (hence, rename file)
- push selection to new .md file (invent `@` name, allow change later)

# Stubs

Not all steps are automated, some require human intervention.

Begin with outline of steps, all non-automated, i.e. implementation is English text.

Refine steps by replacing them with automation.

# Round Trip

Q: How does refining a step reflect back to the original design?

Q: Is the original design the master document?

Q: Do we combine the original design with implementation to produce an app?

- initial version: git-like folding of implementation onto design, complain if mis-match (conflict) ie. implementation does not fit neatly over design 
- AOP for aspects of implementation?, Lisp-like :before and :after
- Paul Bassett's "Framing Software Reuse" for creating app from design+implementation?



# Implementation

Q: Use bash's `#!~/bin/ag` as first line of implementation?

# Short Version

Notation-building = Create Syntax as a skin. Let the Toolbox language handle the rest.

[Akin to using Regexps in JS vs. building a full-blown lexer].

## Mindset

A Notation is a cheap-to-build little language. 

Physicists use a trick: invent a notation to _describe_ a problem, then, _solve_ the problem in that notation.

Programmers do this backwards - they choose the notation first (e.g. FP, Python, etc.), and then force-fit the problem (and the solution) into the notation.


# Syntax is Cheap

It _used to be_ that creating little languages was expensive, e.g. years.  It is, now, possible to build little languages in an afternoon. (One secret is learning how to cheat).

# Goal

Goal: Allow for change. Write code that writes code. 

# Assembler Nouveau

Treat existing languages as "assembler". 

## New-Breed Notations

Python, JS, WASM, Lisp, etc. are but "assembly language" for new-breed Notations.

<h1 id="tokenizing">Tokenizing</h1>

<p>I&#8217;m struggling with this. I think in terms of tokenizing, but Ohm-JS fights me. I was very un-amused to discover that ESRAP only worked with characters (instead of tokens and CL forms).</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t skip whitespace unless the whitespace has been tokenized. Ohm-JS handles languages, like JS, that use commas (,). Ohm-JS creates bugs (accidental complexity) when parsing comma-less languages.</p>

<p>My experiments with ASON parsing<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> using Ohm-JS might show how to tokenize using Ohm-JS.</p>

<h1 id="isolatedcomponents">Isolated Components</h1>

<p>I think in terms of isolated software components.</p>

<p>I want to <em>build-and-forget</em> any component.</p>

<p>Ideally, there are no dependencies between components. Adding new components does not affect the way that old ones work.</p>

<p>[<em>This is possible, but unlikely with current programming languages.</em>]</p>

<p>Parsing and tokenizing is like that. The first pass should break the input into two kinds of tokens</p>

<ol>
<li>whitespace</li>
<li>non-whitespace.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, if we want to delete whitespace, we simple drop tokens of type (1). The rest of the tokens remain the same.</p>

<p>[<em>For the record, I can&#8217;t bring myself to do something this simple using current languages. When I address (1), I immediately worry about counting newlines. Counting lines should, ideally, be done in another pass.</em>]</p>

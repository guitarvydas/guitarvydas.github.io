Unfinished thoughts: My view of the world of software, as best as I can diagram it ATM (at the moment), is below.  Does this spawn any ideas / discussion?  

In essence, I would say that current GPLs are but glorified macro processors (hygienic macro processors, if you believe in type checking and believe that compilers should be built into PLs (compilers are hygienic macro processors, but, use the file system instead of being built into PLs)).  

Something more than that is needed to handle distributed programming.  Treating distributed programming as macros is possible, but, doesn't lead to the most convenient solutions.

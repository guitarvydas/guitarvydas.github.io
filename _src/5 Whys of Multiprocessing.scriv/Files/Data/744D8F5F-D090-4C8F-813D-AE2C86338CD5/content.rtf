\f0\fs26 \cf0 Actually, the physics of parallel systems implies that we must always deal with real race conditions, but, race conditions based on memory sharing, priorities, etc. are accidental complexities.  Race conditions caused by physics were explored and handled in the 1970's by Electrical Engineers.  Maybe even earlier.  Race conditions due to physics are found in the arrival of so-called simultaneous events (we are re-discovering these real problems, when dealing with distributed systems).\

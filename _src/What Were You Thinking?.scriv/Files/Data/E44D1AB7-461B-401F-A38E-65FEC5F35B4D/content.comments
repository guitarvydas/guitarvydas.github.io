\f0\fs24 \cf0 Programmers call this a "tree".  It is really more like a root system of a tree.  Yet, programmers talk about "leaves", as will I.  So, imagine that we cut down a tree and hang it upside-down.  The trunk of the tree is higher than any of the branches.  The branches branch out and get thinner.  At the tips of the branches are "leaves".  The branching stops at the leaves - they don't branch out further (I will ignore the fact that leaves have veins).}]]></Comment>

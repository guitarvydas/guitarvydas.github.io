\f0\fs24 \cf0 Currently, multi-tasking is considered "hard",  Most of the problem is due to Accidental Complexity - the use of Time-Sharing (a hard problem) and the idea that memory needs to be shared.  Both of these are based on old-fashioned criteria that have little to do with generalized multi-tasking.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Smalltalk supported duck-typing with caches.  Methods were first looked up dynamically, then cached.  As the app ran and reached steady-state, the caches would tend towards containing the most-frequently-used methods, resulting in faster lookup for more-frequently-used methods.  Obviously the caches were populated on a per-application basis.  This was \'93good enough\'94 and the compiler remained simple, not needing to predict the frequency-of-use for every method.  \

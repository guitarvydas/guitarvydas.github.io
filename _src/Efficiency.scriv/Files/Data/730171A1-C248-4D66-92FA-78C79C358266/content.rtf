\f0\fs24 \cf0 MC6809 (an 8-bit processor) was more memory efficient than MC68000 (a 16-bit processor) code.  I measured that 6809 code was 40% the size of 68000 code.  I attributed the size difference to be due to the size of instructions \'96 for the 6809, opcodes were bytes (8 bits), whereas for the 68000 opcodes were words (16 bits).\
One of the early Burroughs processors used Huffman Encoding to encode instructions.  The most common instruction was 2-bits long.\

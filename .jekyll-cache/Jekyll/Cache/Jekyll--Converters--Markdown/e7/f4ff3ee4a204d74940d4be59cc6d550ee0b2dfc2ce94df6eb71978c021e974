I"	<p>Nesting seems to be The Answer to everything in software.</p>

<p>We conquered flat assembler programming with Structured Programming - basically drawing a box around a piece of code.</p>

<p>We conquered ‚Äúglobal variables‚Äù with scoping - another word for nesting.</p>

<p>OO gave us nesting of data.  (But, OO does not provide nesting of control flow, in fact OO spaghettifies control flow (overriding, inheritance))</p>

<p>FP lambdas (1st class functions) use The Stack to create dynamic, shared, nesting chains.</p>

<p>Flowcharts nest control flow, but do not nest data.</p>

<p>StateCharts nest control flow (and, flags, and, ‚Äúthe state explosion problem‚Äù).</p>

<p>In ASCII, we represent nesting using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ ... }</code> and function definitions (local variables are nested inside functions).</p>

<p>We draw boxes around code using ASCII instead of using 2D graphics.</p>

<p>We draw flat pictures of trees.  These often represent nested structures, like Russian Dolls.  A ‚Äúnode‚Äù ‚Äúbelow‚Äù another ‚Äúnode‚Äù is a representation of the node contained in the other node.</p>

<p>[Containment === nesting].</p>

<p>Parsing, unlike REGEX, can deal with nested text.</p>

<p>PEG parsing can match balanced parentheses (actually, balanced anything).</p>

<p>This kind of parsing allows us to get away even longer using ASCII Art to represent nested languages.</p>

<p><em>observation</em>: Nesting is needed only when the program does not fit in an eye-full (e.g. an editing window) ; corollary - we don‚Äôt need nesting when code is only 5 lines long (in fact, global variables are not even a problem at that scale (in functional notation, lack-of-nesting is called ‚Äúfree variables‚Äù))</p>

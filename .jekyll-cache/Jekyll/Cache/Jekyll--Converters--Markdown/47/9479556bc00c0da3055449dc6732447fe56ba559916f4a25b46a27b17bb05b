<p>RY mean ‚ÄúRepeat Yourself‚Äù.</p>

<p>Many programs are first created by cut &amp; paste of working code.</p>

<p>Cut/Paste is RY.</p>

<p>Programmers are taught to organize code so that there is little repetition - DRY.</p>

<p>DRY organization is also called <em>scoping</em> (and I call it <em>nesting</em>).</p>

<p>RY introduces multiple degrees of freedom into a design.</p>

<p>In general RY results in dimension explosion.  DRY tries to constrain the explosion by grouping similarities.</p>

<p>An example of RY is shown below.</p>

<p>[This is incorrect code, but shows the problem].</p>

<p>In this (incorrect) code, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">port</code> is</p>
<ul>
  <li>a rectangle that contains nothing else</li>
  <li>a circle that contains nothing else</li>
  <li>a rectangle that contains only one text object</li>
  <li>a circle that contains only one text object.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can write a rule for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">port</code> by making 4 clones of the code, with the appropriate conditions: [where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\+ contains(ID,_)</code> means ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt contain anything‚Äù].</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>% layer high
%     port is a rect or circle that contains nothing
port(ID) :-
    rect(ID,nil),
    \+ contains(ID,_).
port(ID) :-
    circle(ID,nil),
    \+ contains(ID,_).
% or, port is a rect or circle that contains only [text]
port(ID) :-
    rect(ID,nil),
    contains(ID,Other),
    text(Other,nil).
port(ID) :-
    circle(ID,nil),
    contains(ID,Other),
    text(Other,nil).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above is RY.  When we start adding more lines to the code, the code explodes in a number of directions and becomes unmaintainable.</p>

<p>For example, at this point in the design, we want to add one more condition to the rule.  E.G. a port must be a square rectangle.  A rounded rectangle is not a port.</p>

<p>We could just hack on the code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>% layer high
%     port is a rect or circle that contains nothing
port(ID) :-
    rect(ID,nil),
    \+ rounded(ID,nil).
    \+ contains(ID,_).
port(ID) :-
    circle(ID,nil),
    \+ contains(ID,_).
% or, port is a rect or circle that contains only [text]
port(ID) :-
    rect(ID,nil),
    \+ rounded(ID,nil).
    contains(ID,Other),
    text(Other,nil).
port(ID) :-
    circle(ID,nil),
    contains(ID,Other),
    text(Other,nil).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see lots of commonality in the code above.  If we keep hacking, the code will grow in a number of dimensions.</p>

<p>Programmers are taught to apply DRY principles to the above.</p>

<p>Programmers look for commonality and try to constrain it.  The ideal is to lasso every bit of commonality and to create a single rule for each grouping.</p>

<p>We could lasso the shape of ports first - rounded rectangles and squares - or, we could lasso the notions of containing-nothing vs. containing-only-text.</p>

<p>Can we wring out <em>all</em> of the commonalities?</p>

<p>Trying to do this in an <em>all-in-one</em> manner brings complexity into the picture and obscures the final result.  The result might be good from a DRY perspective, but becomes harder to read.</p>

<p>Some call this <em>abstraction</em>.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say that we rewrite the code in the following way:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>% a port is, maybe, a square rect or a circle
maybePort(ID) :-
    squareRect(ID,nil).
maybePort(ID) :-
    circle(ID,nil).
% a port contains nothing, or, 
port(ID) :-
    maybePort(ID),
    containsNothing(ID).
port(ID) :-
    maybePort(ID),
    containsExactlyOneTextItem(ID).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which starts out with rect-ness and circle-ness of ports.</p>

<p>We could write the same code in another way:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>maybePort(ID) :-
    containsNothing(ID).
maybePort(ID) :-
    containsExactlyOneTextItem(ID).
port(ID) :-
    maybePort(ID),
    squareRect(ID).
port(ID) :-
    maybePort(ID),
    circle(ID).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which choice is better?</p>

<p>It depends on the Architect.</p>

<p>Ideally, the code should capture the Architect‚Äôs thought process and make the thought process clear to the reader.</p>

<p>What happens in a more complex situation?  We get <em>flat</em> code that represents a bunch of <em>non-flat</em> decisions that were made by the Architect.</p>

<p>The ideal code would capture that Architect‚Äôs <em>non-flat</em> decisions, e.g. it would be</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>port(ID) :-
    maybePort(ID),
    containsNothing(ID).
port(ID) :-
    maybePort(ID),
    containsExactlyOneTextItem(ID).
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>eliding <em>maybePort</em> and deferring its definition to elsewhere</p>

<p>or</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>port(ID) :-
    maybePort(ID),
    squareRect(ID).
port(ID) :-
    maybePort(ID),
    circle(ID).
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>or, better,</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(squarePort OR circle)
AND
(containsNothing OR containsExactlyOneTextItem)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>or, if we wanted to capture the Architect‚Äôs flow</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(squarePort OR circle) -&gt; (containsNothing OR containsExactlyOneTextItem)
                  else -&gt; fail
</code></pre></div></div>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(containsNothing OR containsExactlyOneTextItem) -&gt; (squarePort OR circle)
                                           else -&gt; fail
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>[In this simple example it is ‚Äúobvious‚Äù that this flow-code is the same as the code that precedes it.  The difference is that the former code uses text only, while the latter uses the ‚Äú-&gt;‚Äù operator to show left-to-right design.]</p>

<h1 id="the-state-explosion-problem">The State Explosion Problem</h1>
<p>State-based code has a similar problem, often call the ‚Äústate explosion problem‚Äù.</p>

<p>StateCharts constrain the State Explosion problem.</p>

<h1 id="database-theory">Database Theory</h1>
<p>Databse theory is the notion of wringing out all commonality in data structures.</p>

<h1 id="user-friendly">User Friendly</h1>

<p>What notation is more user-friendly?</p>

<p>Math?  Math wrings out commonality, but most people dislike the notation.  Mathematics maps a 4D design (X/Y/Z/time<sup id="fnref:time" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:time" class="footnote">1</a></sup>)) to 2D (X/Y, aka text).  [We see this mapping in the above, where the code was abstracted to ‚ÄúmaybePort‚Äù]</p>

<p>Drawings? The idea of running diagrams has not been explored sufficiently (IMO).  Code-&gt;drawings is not sufficient.  We need drawings-&gt;code<sup id="fnref:das" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:das" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>IDEs could deal with DRY and help programmers to specify DRY.  Github uses diff, we just need to use diff for higher level concepts.</p>

<p>OO was an attempt to capture DRY.  OO was unsatisfactory, because of how it warps control-flow.</p>

<p>IDE elision to help programmers create code in layers.  Org-mode for code.</p>

<p>What we <em>really</em> want is to capture the design process.  Did the Architect address this problem by starting with rect/circle commonalities, or, did the Architect start by addressing the containment commonalities.</p>

<p>It helps to know what the Architect was thinking, when one wants to upgrade or otherwise maintain the code.  The above example is simple.  Things get hoary in real-life examples.</p>

<p>To capture this kind of thought process, we need to capture the design over <em>time</em>.  Mathematics wrings <em>time</em> out of its notation.  That is probably one of the reasons that non-mathematicians don‚Äôt like math - it doesn‚Äôt <em>always</em> suit the way they think about certain problems.</p>

<p>We want to capture the thought process, for example</p>
<ul>
  <li>one train of thought starts out with rectangles and circles</li>
  <li>another train of thought starts out with containment (contain nothing, contain only 1 text item).</li>
</ul>

<p>If we could build black boxes and just plug them together, we might be able to capture the thought process, for example:</p>

<ol>
  <li>rect -&gt; not rounded -&gt; contains-nothing -&gt; it‚Äôs a port.</li>
  <li>rect -&gt; not rounded -&gt; contains-1-text-item -&gt; it‚Äôs a port.</li>
  <li>circle -&gt; contains-nothing -&gt; it‚Äôs a port.</li>
  <li>circle -&gt; contains-1-text-item -&gt; it‚Äôs a port.</li>
  <li>contains-nothing -&gt; rect -&gt; not rounded -&gt; it‚Äôs a port</li>
  <li>contains-1-text-item -&gt; rect -&gt; not rounded -&gt; it‚Äôs a port</li>
  <li>contains-nothing -&gt; circle -&gt; it‚Äôs a port</li>
  <li>contains-1-text-item -&gt; circle -&gt; it‚Äôs a port.</li>
</ol>

<p>Programmers are taught to abstract the above choices down to fewer choices.</p>

<p>Math notation can capture the above choices, but doesn‚Äôt show any kind of ordering (by the Architect).</p>

<p>Box-and-arrow notation, using black boxes, can capture the above and show the ordering of design.</p>

<p><em>Isolation</em> could be used to create pluggable components.</p>

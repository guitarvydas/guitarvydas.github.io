I"ö<p>REPL means ‚Äútrying things out‚Äù.</p>

<p>It is derived from the words ‚ÄúRead Eval Print Loop‚Äù which were parts of the original Lisp REPL.</p>

<h2 id="continuum">Continuum</h2>

<p>REPLs form a continuum</p>
<ul>
  <li>at one extreme is the programming language REPL of Lisp</li>
  <li>at the other extreme is ‚ÄúLive Programming‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bret-victor">Bret Victor</h2>

<p>IMO, a lot of Bret Victor‚Äôs independent work boils down to REPLs.</p>

<h2 id="rapid-prototyping">Rapid Prototyping</h2>

<p>Hmm, is <em>rapid prototyping</em> just a way to try out designs?</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-languages-vs-static-languages">Dynamic Languages vs. Static Languages</h2>

<p>Hmm, <em>dynamic languages</em> tend to allow experimentation.</p>

<p><em>Static languages</em> (compilable languages) tend to inhibit experimentation and expect that you already know what you want.</p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt already know what you want yet, e.g. when starting a new project, compiled languages get in the way of free-form thinking about the problem.</p>

<p>Compilers are optimizers for designs.</p>

<p>Some people argue that type systems - compiler languages on steroids - help them design a problem.  I would argue that <em>exploring a problem</em> is Design.  IMO, type systems are but <em>one</em> way to <em>explore a problem</em>.</p>

<p>If your problem involves plumbing bits of data together, then types might act as useful models.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, your problem involves plugging control-flow bits together, then types might not be the most useful models. Extreme examples of this are lambda calculus<sup id="fnref:lc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lc" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and continuation-passing style.  The actual unit of pluggability consists of one type - the control-flow-doo-dad (aka function).</p>

<h2 id="waterfall-design">Waterfall Design</h2>

<p>Imagining that you already know what you want, just by <em>imagining it</em> and not <em>trying it out</em> is the essence of Waterfall Design.</p>

<p>Air Design is like playing Air Guitar.  It sounds perfect in your imagination.</p>

<h2 id="primitive-repls">Primitive REPLs</h2>
<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>

<p>Artists <em>try out</em> art using paper and pencil before commiting to final implementations of the art.</p>

<h3 id="songwriting">Songwriting</h3>

<p>Songwriters <em>try out</em> phrases before commiting to a final form for the song.</p>

<p>See the bus scene in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_Mile_\(film\)">8 Mile</a><sup id="fnref:pp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pp" class="footnote">2</a></sup> for a graphic example of how one successful songwriter used pen-and-paper as a REPL.</p>

I"Ş<p>â€œFDDâ€ means â€œFailure Driven Designâ€.</p>

<p>FDD can prevent future bugs.</p>

<p>FDD is like â€œdesign ruleâ€ checking built into the dev app.</p>

<p>I spent hours tracking down a hoary bug in my logic.</p>

<p>I wrote:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>â€¦ (Kind, Edge, edge)
â€¦ sourceof(Edge, Sender)
â€¦ targetof(Edge, Receiver)
â€¦ (direct_contains, Parent, Edge)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Which failed silently using PROLOG rules.</p>

<p>The final clause â€œâ€¦ (direct_contains, Parent, Edge)â€ was not fulfufilled due to a bug in my logic - the outer-most container did not have a Parent.</p>

<p>Nothing could prevent me from making this mistake, but, it is possible to prevent <em>other</em> errors of this kind.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-wanted-to-say">What I Wanted to Say</h1>
<p>I wanted to say:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Forall â€œâ€¦ (kind, Edge, edge)â€, and, 
 There must be a fact â€œâ€¦ sourceof(Edge, Sender)â€, and,
 There must be a fact â€œâ€¦ targetof(Edge, Receiver)â€, and,
 There must be a fact â€œâ€¦ (direct_contains, Parent, Edge)â€
else
 fail loudly
</code></pre></div></div>

<h1 id="what-i-really-said">What I Really Said</h1>

<p>But, I wrote:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Forall â€œâ€¦ (Kind, Edge, edge)â€
 And, if there is a fact â€œâ€¦ sourceof(Edge, Sender)â€,
 And, if there is a fact â€œâ€¦ targetof(Edge, Receiver)â€,
 And, ifthere is a fact â€œâ€¦ (direct_contains, Parent, Edge)â€
 succeed
</code></pre></div></div>
<h1 id="whats-the-difference">Whatâ€™s the Difference?</h1>
<p>A subtle difference.</p>

<p>The And version silently fails if ANY of the 4 clauses is false.</p>

<p>Subtle bugs are the hardest to find.</p>

<h1 id="preventing-errors-using-fdd">Preventing Errors Using FDD</h1>

<p>Using FDD mentality, I can change the meaning of:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>â€¦ (kind, Edge, edge)
â€¦ sourceof(Edge, Sender)
â€¦ targetof(Edge, Receiver)
â€¦ (direct_contains, Parent, Edge)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To mean what I wanted and simply push a button to regenerate the whole shebang, and, raise errors for any other latent bugs of this nature.</p>

<h2 id="example-design-rule-check">Example Design Rule Check</h2>

<p>I can choose syntax to map to meaning - I might change the generated code to match what I wanted to say.</p>

<p>For example, I might generate code that matched the first clause, then asserted the rest of the clauses (with appropriate error messages), e.g.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>â€¦ (kind, Edge, edge)
(â€¦ sourceof(Edge, Sender)â€ -&gt; true ; format(user_error, â€œFAILURE sourceof(Edge,Sender) failed on ~w~n)â€, [Edge])
(â€¦ (targetof(Edge, Receiver) -&gt; true ; format(user_error, "FAILURE:targetof(Edge, Receiver) ~w~n)", [Edge])
(â€¦ (direct_contains, Parent, Edge)â€ -&gt; true ; format(user_error, "FAILURE: direct_contains, Parent, Edge) ~w~n)", [Edge])
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The above code looks horrible and hides the true essence of what I want to say, but, the machine doesnâ€™t care and will check my other code for errors.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m using PROLOG (swipl) as <em>assembler</em> and Iâ€™m emitting assembler code (PROLOG) to do what I want.</p>

<p>I can modify the DSL syntax, push a button, and have ALL of my code checked.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t need to look at the generated assembler code (PROLOG)<sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Yes, there might be cases where I want to say AND instead of â€œthere must be a factâ€.  I will modify (invent) the syntax to handle such cases.  I expect that most of my code is based on â€œthere must be a factâ€ rules, with AND rules being the exception.  I intend to invent a syntax to express AND rules, and, I will use the FDD transpiler to find those cases for me (in the current code base).</p>

<p>FDD lets me make sweeping changes such as this.</p>

<p>I need to modify the transpiler, then I need to push a button (or invoke <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./run.bash</code>).</p>

<p>Not a lot of work, but it captures one of my pervasive errors in logicâ€¦</p>

<p>Yes, I <em>could</em> have written the code correctly in the first place, but that would require a lot more thinking on my part (and, probably, a PhD degree).</p>

<p>I said what I wanted to say.  Now, using FDD, my only task is to make the computer (transpiler) <em>do</em> what I wantedâ€¦</p>

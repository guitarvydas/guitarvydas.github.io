<p>The goal is to refactor <em>architecture</em>.</p>

<p>Refactoring code is but a low-level subset of refactoring architecture.</p>

<p>The goal is to write a full application in one line of code<sup id="fnref:apl" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:apl" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Lots of thinking - very little coding.</p>

<h2 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h2>

<p>The biggest efficiency gains come from refactoring architecture, not code.</p>

<p>Using, say Rust, will not buy you efficiency if your architecture sucks.</p>

<p>If you have more than one page of code, then it is safe to say that your architecture sucks.</p>

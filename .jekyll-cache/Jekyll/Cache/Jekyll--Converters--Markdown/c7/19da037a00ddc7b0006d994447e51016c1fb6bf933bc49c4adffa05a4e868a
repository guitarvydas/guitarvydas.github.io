<p>We examine how multitasking is implemented on a single CPU system.</p>

<p>This same strategy applies to multi-core systems (albeit, with more details).</p>

<h1 id="single-cpu---global-everything">Single CPU - Global Everything</h1>

<p>On a single CPU, hardware provides us with</p>

<ol>
  <li>memory (RAM)</li>
  <li>registers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Memory and registers are globals, shared by all functions on the CPU.</p>

<p>Notably, there are two most-interesting registers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PC - the program counter - memory address of the function (code) currently being executed.</li>
  <li>SP - the stack pointer - memory address of the top of the ‚Äústack‚Äù.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="cons-car-and-cdr">CONS, CAR and CDR</h1>

<p>[<em>You don‚Äôt need to understand Lisp for this, although, for convenience, I use Lisp-y terminology.</em>]</p>

<p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CDR</code> is a pointer to the next cell.</p>

<p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CAR</code> is data.</p>

<p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONS</code> is a cell containing one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CAR</code> and one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CDR</code>.</p>

<p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONS</code> cell can be implemented (specified) as a <em>user-defined data structure</em> or a <em>class</em>.</p>

<h1 id="stack">Stack</h1>

<p>The <em>stack</em> is simply an optimized list.</p>

<p>The <em>stack</em> is an array of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CAR</code>s, with no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CDR</code>s.</p>

<p>There is no need to <em>point</em> to the next cell, since all cells are continguous (i.e. an array).  Hence, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CDR</code> is optimized-away.</p>

<p>Hardware implements access to the <em>stack</em> using a special register called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SP</code>.</p>

<p>There is typically only one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SP</code> in a CPU and it is shared (global) by all code<sup id="fnref:code" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:code" class="footnote">1</a></sup> on that CPU.</p>

<h1 id="globals">Globals</h1>

<p>In a single CPU, all memory and all registers are <em>global</em> to all functions (code) on that CPU.</p>

<h1 id="synopsis---faking-multitasking">Synopsis - Faking Multitasking</h1>

<p>We fake out multitasking by creating a component for each process, with its own virtual memory and virtual register set.</p>

<p>We call such components <em>threads</em>.</p>

<p>We use libraries, called <em>operating systems</em>, to help handle the repetitive, detailed work under-the-hood.</p>

<p>We supercede operating systems‚Äô scheduling decisions when we use CALL and RETURN assembler instructions.</p>

<p>We treat all components as being synchronous.</p>

<h1 id="too-few-cpus---faking-multitasking">Too Few CPUs - Faking Multitasking</h1>

<p>We only need to fake multitasking when we have fewer CPUs than we have components (threads).</p>

<p>In the 1950‚Äôs, CPUs were expensive.  We time-sliced CPUs to save money.</p>

<p>Today, CPU‚Äôs are cheap.  IoT (internet of things) goes to the extreme of providing on CPU for <em>each</em> thread (one thread per device).</p>

<h1 id="faking-multitasking-threads">Faking Multitasking Threads</h1>

<p>To fake out multitasking, most operating systems wrap all of the globals inside an envelope and create a fresh envelope for each <em>process</em>.</p>

<p>Operating systems tweak the MMU<sup id="fnref:mmu" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mmu" class="footnote">2</a></sup> to fake out a fresh memory space for each process.</p>

<p>Operating systems tweak the PC<sup id="fnref:pc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pc" class="footnote">3</a></sup> register to fake out unique running functions for each process.</p>

<p>Operating systems tweak the SP<sup id="fnref:sp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sp" class="footnote">4</a></sup> register to fake out a unique stack for each process.</p>

<p>The SP is made to point to the memory space of the process, which is determined by the MMU, which is tweaked by the operating system to match each process.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/guitarvydas/guitarvydas.github.io/blob/master/assets/Multiptasking-Multiple%20Processes.png?raw=true" alt="Multiptasking-Multiple Processes.png" style="zoom:67%;" /></p>

<h2 id="programmable-calculators">Programmable Calculators</h2>

<p>The current FP<sup id="fnref:fp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fp" class="footnote">5</a></sup> fad treats all computers as programmable calculators.</p>

<p>Computers are capable of being more than just programmable calculators.  For example, computers can sequence the operation of devices.</p>

<p>The programmable-caculator fiction has some conveniences.</p>

<p>For example, this fiction allows the use of a notation called <em>mathematics</em>.</p>

<p>This notation relies on one feature - the feature of substituting one piece of notation for another, e.g. replacing one function by another function that has exactly the same input(s) and output(s)<sup id="fnref:rt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rt" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This feature comes with some restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>side-effects are not allowed</li>
  <li>every function must return a value(s)</li>
  <li>when a function is invoked, the calling function schedules itself to sleep until the called function has finished its work and has returned a value(s).  This is called synchronous operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The notation makes certain types of things hard to express, e.g.</p>

<ul>
  <li>multitasking</li>
  <li>functions that run forever (for example <em>servers</em>)</li>
  <li>one-way functionality (also called <em>history</em>)<sup id="fnref:ip" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ip" class="footnote">7</a></sup></li>
  <li>asynchronous operation (e.g. distributed processing, like internet, blockchain, p2p, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>[<em>Note that the notation called ‚Äúmathematics‚Äù can express these things, but results in complicated expressions of these concepts that tend not to be popular.  We teach hard realtime notation to 5-year-olds (e.g. piano lessons) but need university training to understand multitasking when expressed in mathematical terminology.</em>]</p>

<h1 id="conflating-control-flow-and-data">Conflating Control Flow and Data</h1>

<p>A computer deals with 2 concepts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>memory</li>
  <li>control-flow.</li>
</ol>

<p>One way to imagine these concepts is to think of asynchronous components that send messages<sup id="fnref:msg" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:msg" class="footnote">8</a></sup> to one another.</p>

<p>Each component has its own memory which is not shared with other components.</p>

<p>Unique memory is contained in each component.</p>

<p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dispatcher</code> determines which component is allowed to run (i.e. gets control of the CPU and all of its globals).</p>

<p>Currently, we use various general-purpose programming languages to program the internals of components and use operating systems to dispatch components (which are called threads / processes).</p>

<h1 id="ad-hoc-dispatch---callreturn">Ad-Hoc Dispatch - CALL/RETURN</h1>

<p>Currently, functions perform ad-hoc dispatch by calling other functions (e.g. using the built-in CALL and RETURN assembler instructions).</p>

<p>Functions perform a rendezvous-dance with callees and supercede dispatching decisions made by the operating system.</p>

<p>Operating systems are built to wrench dispatching control away from functions using <em>preemption</em>.</p>

<h1 id="rendezvous">Rendezvous</h1>

<p>Rendezvous is a subset of message-passing.</p>

<p>Rendezvous is a method for converting asynchronous processes into synchronous processes.</p>

<p>In a rendezvous, a component can send exactly one message.</p>

<p>The sending component must wait until the receiver accepts the message and sends back a completion event.</p>

<p>Rendezvous treats all message queues between components, as being 1 item in length.</p>

<h1 id="dispatcher">Dispatcher</h1>

<p>We fake out multitasking by providing a single routine which I call the <em>dispatcher</em>.</p>

<p>Each CPU is, in essence, its own dispatcher.</p>

<p>We need to provide explicit dispatchers only when we fake out multitasking.</p>

<h1 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h1>

<p>A hardware CPU is an interpreter.</p>

<p>It is hard-wired to interpret assembly instructions.</p>

<p>In the simplest cases, i.e. without operating systems, CPUs interpret instructions for a single thread.</p>

<p>If more threads on a single CPU are needed, we add complexity by adding operating systems to fake out multitasking.</p>

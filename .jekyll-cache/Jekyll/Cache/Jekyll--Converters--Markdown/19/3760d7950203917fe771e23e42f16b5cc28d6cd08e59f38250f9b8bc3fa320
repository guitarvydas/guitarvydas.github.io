I"ı<p>FP emphasizes <em>immutability</em> of data, but the data is only <em>immutable</em> â€œin the smallâ€.</p>

<p>Data - even in FP - is <em>mutable</em> when the whole system is taken into account.</p>

<p>For example, imagine how miniKanren operates - it produces an initial match query, then passes the resulting datum on to subsequent queries which transmogrify the datum.</p>

<p>At the atomic level, it appears that no operation can modify (mutate) the datum.</p>

<p>At a system-level, though, the datum is actually modified, often by appending new information to the datum.</p>

<p>[Aside: you donâ€™t need FP to create this kind of â€œimmutableâ€ data. In other essays, I argue that factbases should only be extended and that facts should not be deleted from factbases.  FBs <em>acrete</em> data, and never delete it.  Deletion of data is only an optimization.]</p>

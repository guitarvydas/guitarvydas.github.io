I"ç	<p>The relation</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contains(rect, circle)</code></p>

<p>usually implemented as a pointer from rect -&gt; circle (and, maybe, circle -&gt; rect, or both).</p>

<p>Such pointers are relations.  They can be represented as relations:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>contains(rect,circle).
containedby(circle,rect).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Information is not lost in the relational representation.</p>

<p>Information is <em>flatttened</em> to its simplest form - a <em>relation</em>.</p>

<p>Persisting information in flattened form is more flexible, but, if you want to (re-)structure the data, it takes work (CPU).</p>

<p>With modern hardware, this extra work is inexpensive.  The reconstruction work happens quickly and uses cheap memory.</p>

<p>Machine time is inexpensive.</p>

<p>Machines (computers) can perform repetitive work flawlessly.</p>

<p>Flexibility equates to savings of architecting time (human time, programming time).</p>

<p>Destruction of flexibility is an optimization and should be used sparingly.</p>

<p>On modern hardware, optimization is not needed in most use-cases.</p>

<p>Destruction of flexibility also tends to destroy DI.  Optimization conflates architectural concerns with optimization concerns.  This tends to obfuscate DI. This affects understandability and, therefore, affects maintenance.</p>

<p>Unnecessary optimization is a bad idea.</p>

<p>The plus operator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> is an optimization of the plus function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plus()</code>.  Any language that provides a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> operator is - at least psychologically - encouraging optimization in preference to DI.</p>

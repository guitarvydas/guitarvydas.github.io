<p>Many software designs start out life as drawings on a whiteboard.</p>

<h1 id="tell">Tell</h1>

<p>This is a <em>tell</em> that our programming notation should include whiteboard-level diagrams.</p>

<h1 id="layered-details">Layered Details</h1>

<p>Most whiteboard diagrams do not contain enough technical detail to be implemented using computer programs.</p>

<p>This is another <em>tell</em> that most people, e.g. CEOs, don’t want to specify all of the details of a solution.</p>

<p>It is expected that Engineers will fill in the details.  That is what Engineers get paid to do.</p>

<h1 id="engineers-dont-write-code">Engineers Don’t Write Code</h1>

<p>Engineers fill in the details for a design, but don’t actually write code.</p>

<p>Code is written by Implementors, much in the same way that building Architects and building Engineers draw up blueprints and hand the blueprints off to Construction Workers for implementation.</p>

I"Ë<h1 id="iot">IoT</h1>

<p>IoT means Internet of Things.</p>

<p>Basically, this means that each device has its own CPU.</p>

<p>CPUs are cheap, now, and the use of multiple CPUs can be imagined.  This idea couldnâ€™t be realized/imagined in the 1950â€™s when CPUs were expensive.</p>

<h1 id="what-has-changed">What Has Changed?</h1>

<p>What are the old-fashioned concepts that are no longer true in IoT?</p>

<h2 id="time-sharing">Time-Sharing</h2>

<p>CPUs are cheap now.</p>

<p>Each device can have its own CPU.</p>

<p>It is no longer necessary to slice CPU time using time-sharing.</p>

<h2 id="memory-sharing">Memory Sharing</h2>

<p>Memory is cheap now.</p>

<p>Each device can have its own memory</p>

<p>It is no longer necessary to share memory.</p>

<p>[<em>Some applications need to transfer large amounts of data - memory - and such applications still need to use memory sharing.  Memory-sharing should be the exception, not the rule.</em>]</p>

<h1 id="yet">Yetâ€¦</h1>

<p>Yet, we continue to put full-blown operating systems - with full preemption and memory-sharing - onto small CPUs, like Raspberry PIs.</p>

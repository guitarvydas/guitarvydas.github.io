I"ğ<p>The earliest interpreters read the program in line-by-line and interpreted each line as they were read in.</p>

<p>GOTO was a â€œproblemâ€. It meant that the interpreter had to re-read certain lines and had to re-interpret those lines.</p>

<p>Quickly, it was realized that interpreters could be made more efficient.</p>

<p>First, interpreters just read all of the lines into memory, in a buffer.</p>

<p>Then, interpreters started to use â€œbytecodesâ€, but every interpreter used a different set of bytecodes. (The first one I remember seeing was Tiny Basic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC)).</p>

<p>Then, they noticed that EVERY interpreter used a different set of bytecodes.</p>

<p>This was â€œstandardizedâ€ and became a VM. I <em>think</em> that the first VM was in early Smalltalk (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine), but Java really popularized the concept with the JVM. Sun produced Java and backed/advertised the JVM.</p>

<p>The hard part of programming is the thinking part.</p>

<p>Coding is easy.</p>

<p>Coding is easy when you know what to code.</p>

<p>Ideally, a program should consist of one line of code.</p>

<p>I’ve never achieved this ideal<sup id="fnref:apl" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:apl" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but I have written whole solutions in about one page of code.</p>

<p>I concentrate on the thinking, and de-emphasize the coding.</p>

      <p>I came close to describing a complete solution in one line of code when in APL, but that was one very complicated line of code. <a href="#fnref:apl" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

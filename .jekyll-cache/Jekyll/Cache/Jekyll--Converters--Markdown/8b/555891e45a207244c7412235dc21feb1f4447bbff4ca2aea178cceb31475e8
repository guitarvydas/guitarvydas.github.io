I"ó<p>A scalable component is one which coordinates children components and filters their results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>input: commands from parent</li>
  <li>output: filtered data to parent</li>
  <li>contains: child components.</li>
</ul>

<p>Children can <em>send</em> information to parents and commands/requests to their own children.</p>

<p>Children must not leak information in any other direction.</p>

<p>A parent completes an operation when all of its children have completed sub-operations.</p>

<p>Corollary: a parent component is busy as long as any of its children components are busy (recursively).</p>

I"Y<p>Refactoring is accidental complexity.</p>

<p>Accidental complexity is also known as “epicycles”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The need to refactor a design or to refactor code, should be a red flag.</p>

<p>Refactoring should never be needed in a design which has been decomposed into its most-atomic units.</p>

<p>Refactoring is accidental complexity caused by too much structure in a design.</p>

<p>Structure can be added in by creating queries.</p>

<p>Structure should not be baked into a factbase.</p>

<p>[Structure in queries is OK, structure in factbases is bad].</p>

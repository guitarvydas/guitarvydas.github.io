I"´<h2 id="org-charts">ORG Charts</h2>
<p>Business organizations are built in a scalable manner.</p>

<p>Business organizations are described by ORG Charts.</p>

<h1 id="trees">Trees</h1>

<p>ORG Charts are usually expressed as <em>trees</em>.</p>

<p>Managers at higher levels in the ORG Chart pass commands/requirements down to mid-level managers.  Mid-level managers pass commands/requirements down to lower-level managers and so on until the commands reach the bottom of the tree.</p>

<p>Mid-level managers â€œreportâ€ upwards to higher-level managers providing summaries of activities and eliding details.</p>

<p>In a smooth-running business, no manager - at any level - is swamped by detail.</p>

<h1 id="breaking-the-tree-structure">Breaking the Tree Structure</h1>

<p>Businesses use the phrases â€œ<em>micro-management</em>â€ and â€œ<em>going over the bossâ€™s head</em>â€ to describe non-scalable violations of the organizationâ€™s tree structure.</p>

<p>In software, we call these kinds of violations <em>dags</em> instead of <em>trees</em>.</p>

  <li>Game changing technology
    <ul>
      <li>allows bowls of syntax approach, instead of many-years-for-one-language approach</li>
      <li>PEG uses backtracking, which used to be verbotten in the mid-1900s</li>
      <li>PEG is like PROLOG aimed for backtracking over text characters</li>
      <li>Kleene <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> and Kleene <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> were invented long ago, but not thought to be useful for parsing due to concerns for efficiency ; current computers are magnitudes better than in the mid-1900s -&gt; time to reevaluate basic assumptions, esp. concerns for efficiency</li>
      <li>PEG allows matching balanced parens, YACC/language-theory/etc. cannot match balanced parens</li>
      <li>PEG is akin to: automobile vs. walking - changes basic assumptions about what is possible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a Parser is just a program, an app
    <ul>
      <li>REGEX is a simplified form of pattern-matching</li>
      <li>PEG is a DSL meant specifically for pattern-matching sequences of characters</li>
      <li>PEG is better than REGEX because PEG allows subroutines</li>
      <li>PEG is worse than REGEX because PEG specs are usually larger than REGEX specs</li>
      <li>REGEX syntax is write-only, PEG syntax is more readable (IMO)</li>
      <li>PEG is like modernized BNF</li>

          <li>build ‚Äúmany‚Äù trees, as pipelined, serialized-streams of characters

              <li>use many parsers to expand &amp; unserialize intermediate trees</li>
              <li>helps stop tangling of issues and Accidental Complexity

                  <li>unwinds dependencies</li>
                  <li>each step / phase is independent and can be programmed in situ

                  <li>PEG allows programmer to define layers (‚Äúrules‚Äù) then backtracks</li>
                  <li>miniKanren performs exhaustive match, like PROLOG, without backtracking</li>
                  <li>(backtracking is an attempt at memory optimization - reuse memory by GC‚Äôing it, then trying again, miniKanren doesn‚Äôt care, it just keeps every possibility on deck as it works)

  <li>beauty of Lisp and Assembler

      <li>prefix notation</li>
      <li>very regular -&gt; automatable
        <ul>
          <li>machines can do the work instead of humans</li>
          <li>frees up human thinking to consider higher level concepts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>leads to observation that operators are orthogonal to operands (Cordy‚Äôs Orthogonal Code Generator)
        <ul>
          <li>GCC‚Äôs RTL is a special case of this observation (in RTL <em>all</em> operands are registers until the final step)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>in Lisp, <em>everything</em> is an expression, no special syntax for <em>return</em> -&gt; regularity (normalization)</li>
      <li>Lambda Calculus is discovering normalization</li>
      <li>Sector Lisp (Tunney) is a fine example of the beauty of the FP paradigm
        <ul>
          <li>my conclusion: bloatware comes from forcing a paradigm to be something it wasn‚Äôt designed for</li>
          <li>e.g. FP vs. mutability
            <ul>
              <li>Tunney‚Äôs GC is 40 bytes[sic] becase it is pure FP
                <ul>
                  <li>no special cases</li>
                  <li>very few (2) data types - Atoms and Lists</li>

      <li>Lisp was schizophrenic
        <ul>
          <li>Lisp tried to serve 2 masters at once
            <ol>
              <li>Design</li>
              <li>Production Engineering</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Production Engineering ‚Äúwon out‚Äù and warped Lisp (-&gt; Common Lisp, Scheme)</li>
          <li>REPL is a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù outcome of Design-oriented thinking (see Bret Victor, Live Programming - which are REPLs for non-text-based programming)</li>
          <li>dynamic languages are better for Design, static languages are better for Production Engineering
            <ul>
              <li>using static languages for Design, inhibits Design</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Lispworks debugger is better (IMO) than VSCode
            <ul>
              <li>Lispworks has more experience</li>
              <li>dynamic languages -&gt; less trouble to build debuggers than with static languages</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>IMO - data should be OO objects, and, orthogonally, control flow should be syntax<br />
     - flags, state, etc. are not inherently bad<br />
     - unrestricted use of flags is bad, just like unrestricted use of Global Variables is bad<br />
     - wrap syntax <em>skins</em> around hoary contructs and never allow users to access them directly<br />
     - Lambda Calculus wraps data items dynamically (on the stack), and, now syntax can wrap stuff that LC is not designed for (using PEG)<br />
     - FP teaches that <em>variable</em> names are inconsequential<br />
         - in fact, variables are not variable<br />
     - parsing teaches that <em>syntax</em> is equally inconsequential</li>
  <li>Parser DSL
    <ul>
      <li>theory is for theoreticians
        <ul>
          <li>leads to better languages, but slowly</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>DSL is UX
        <ul>
          <li>theoreticians tend to ‚Äúignore‚Äù UX and don‚Äôt care if they mangle languages for the sake of correctness</li>
          <li>IMO, the ideal is theory -&gt; lint-like tools that preen programmer code, not warp the languages that programmers are allowed to use</li>
          <li>theory -&gt; helps Production Engineers, hinders Designers
            <ul>
              <li>self-editing is ‚Äúbad‚Äù</li>
              <li>implementation details obfuscate Design</li>
              <li>implementation details inhibit Design and destroy Design ‚Äúflow‚Äù (‚Äúin the zone‚Äù)</li>
              <li>biggest advances in CompSci come from eliding and deferring details, e.g. OO, GC, Scoping, Structured Programming, etc.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>i.e. PEG is for programmers, language theory is for theorists
        <ul>
          <li>the two don‚Äôt mix and cannot be combined into a single language</li>
          <li>PEG allows rapid syntax creation -&gt; one language for programmers, another language for theorists, same bag of paradigms with different syntactic sugar</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>PEG paper by B. Ford -&gt; shows that squishy concepts for parsing can be theorized and used to build UXs for programmers<br />
     - paper basically shows how to build backtracking for text without using PROLOG<br />
     - uses memoization to avoid re-parsing already-parsed bits<br />
     - concerns for efficiency are misplaced<br />
         - based on assumption that programs will grow ‚Äúbig‚Äù<br />
         - if you keep programs ‚Äúsmall‚Äù, then efficiency ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù<br />
         - IMO: the goal shoud be to keep programs small instead of appeasing bigness<br />
         - I built a PEG without packrat and it worked fine, since, using the new DSL, programs never became big<br />
         - conclusion: when programs become big enough for efficiency to matter, switch notations (create and use a different language)</li>
  <li>PREP
    <ul>
      <li>I built a tool using PEG and REGEX that allows me to write pipelined one-liners (in <em>bash</em> modulo accompanying grammar and reformat specs)</li>
      <li>use it to build variants of itself (feed <em>prep</em> pipelines with <em>prep</em> preprocessors) -&gt; syntax directed transpiling</li>

<ul>
  <li>replace use of REGEX with use of PEG<br />
      - use REGEX for small snippets of pattern-matching<br />
      - use PEG for anything more interesting, esp. structured text (multiline, recursive)</li>
  <li>Programming Languages are IDEs<br />
          - PLs are IDEs for programming (goal === control a machine)<br />
          - PL‚Äôs based on biases of mid-1900s, e.g. text, concerns for efficiency<br />
          - PEG, esp. Ohm-JS, allows jail-break from some of these mid-1900s assumptions<br />
          - IMO ideal IDE for programming -&gt;<br />
              - choice of notations, text, diagram, hybrid, etc.<br />
              - choice of design rules<br />
                  - more specific than type checking<br />
                  - tuned to specific project, not generalized<br />
                  - PEG allows specializing syntax per project<br />
                  - PEG allows many syntaxes for a single project<br />

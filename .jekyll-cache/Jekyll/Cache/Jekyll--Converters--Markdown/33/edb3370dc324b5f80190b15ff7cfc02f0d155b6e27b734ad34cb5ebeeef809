<p>We have a zillion techniques for programming.</p>

<h1 id="complex-techniques">Complex Techniques</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Operating System - glorified libraries, include time-sharing and memory sharing in every app</li>
  <li>Synchronous</li>
  <li>Python, JS, Perl, etc.</li>
  <li>Mathematical Notation - rules for textual substitution - developed with text (when pen-and-paper was the only choice) - continue, blindly, with text</li>
  <li>Compile Time vs. Run Time fallacy</li>
  <li>two syntaxes for every language</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-is-the-atom-of-software">What is the ATOM of Software?</h1>

<p>Trying to answer this question is one of my goals.</p>

<p>Currently, I think that <em>triples</em> are The Atom.</p>

<p>Currently, I think that <em>relations</em> (relation x subject x object) are the most succinct form of triples.</p>

<p>Currently, I think that Curried functions are actually triples in disguise. (A function of one argument is a double waiting to be completed by applying it to an Object).</p>

I"’<p>Late binding = dynamic typing. Â </p>

<p>Typing done at runtime. Â Repeatedly.</p>

<p>Dynamic typing is often confused with No Typing. Â Not the same.</p>

<p>Compiling is Production Engineering (which Kay mistakenly calls Software Engineering<sup id="fnref:eng" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:eng" class="footnote">1</a></sup>).</p>

<p>Pour your Smarties out on the desk and sort them. Â Red ones over here, green ones over there, â€¦</p>

<p>If you can sort programming constructs like Smarties, you can pre-compile some of them and avoid doing them repeatedly at runtime.</p>

<p>Design â‰¡ being able to change your mind rapidly â‰¡ dynamic typing.</p>

<p>If you can sort programming constructs like Smarties, you can catch stupid mistakes earlier.</p>

<p>If you rely on static typing <em>only</em>, you inhibit Design.</p>

<p>Static binding says that variable names are inconsequential.</p>

<p>In the extreme - all syntax is inconsequential.</p>

<p>Syntax is just a <em>skin</em> draped over loftier concepts like paradigms.</p>

      <p>Engineering is more nuanced than just <em>optimization</em>.  First, comes figuring <em>what</em> all of the details are, then, comes <em>optimizing</em> those details.  Architects think about details, too, but, different details (like â€œhow does this fit in the eco-system?â€ (sometimes AKA â€œUXâ€)).Â <a href="#fnref:eng" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

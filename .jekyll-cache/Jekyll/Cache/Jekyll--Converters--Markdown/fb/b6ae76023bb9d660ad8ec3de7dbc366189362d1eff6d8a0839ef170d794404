<p>Functional programming breaks down into two actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>pattern matching</li>
  <li>text replacement &amp; manipulation</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="pattern-matching">Pattern Matching</h3>

<p>Pattern matching is <em>parsing</em>.</p>

<p>Currently, the easiest parsing method is PEG.</p>

<p>My favorite variant of PEG is Ohm-JS.</p>

<p>Ohm-JS claims to simplify PEG parsing, through various complicated means (upper-case vs. lower-case rules).</p>

<p>The real gems in Ohm-JS are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Separation of Concerns (grammar separated from semantics, unlike in other variants of PEG)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Ohm-editor.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The Ohm-editor simplifies the act of building parsers.</p>

<p>If I were to use any other PEG library, I would use the Ohm-editor first.</p>

<h3 id="text-manipulation">Text Manipulation</h3>

<p>Functional programming, and mathematical notation, imposes the restriction that there can be no side-effects.</p>

<p>In fact, this is only a subset of the more important idea of <em>isolation</em>.</p>

<p>You can allow mutation, and, you can build components that are arbitrarily complex, <em>as long as the components are isolated</em>.</p>

<h2 id="isolation">Isolation</h2>
<p>Isolation is more important than complexity.</p>

<p>Isolation is more important than immutability.</p>

<h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3>
<p>Isolation provides scalability.</p>

<h3 id="black-boxes">Black Boxes</h3>
<p>Isolation means that you can treat  Components as black boxes - input &amp; outputs, we canâ€™t care about what is inside.</p>
<h2 id="everything-is-a-fractal">Everything Is A Fractal</h2>

<p>Everything is a fractal.</p>

<p>Everything can be further sub-divided.</p>

<p>That includes everything I write.  Nothing I write is <em>absolute</em>, it is <em>relative</em>, and, it can be broken down.</p>

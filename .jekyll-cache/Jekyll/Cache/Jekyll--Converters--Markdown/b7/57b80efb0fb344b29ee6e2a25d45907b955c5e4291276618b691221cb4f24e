I"]<p>I have stumbled upon an article about “First Principles Thinking” https://fs.blog/first-principles/.</p>

<p>I wonder/believe whether “First Principles Thinking” describes at least part of my approach.  My writing seems to be “all over the place” - a collection of seemingly random observations. I think that I try to find the <em>atoms</em> of software, then try to re-synthesize the act of programming.</p>

<p>What I call <em>simplicity</em> and what I call <em>atoms of software</em> are strongly related.</p>

<p>I don’t think that there is <em>one</em> programming language nor <em>one</em> thread through all of this stuff.  The idea of atoms allows one to construct any number of molecules that address programming from many angles.</p>

<p>One angle is never enough.</p>

<p>“Fads” are created when someone professes one angle to be more important than a plethora of angles.</p>

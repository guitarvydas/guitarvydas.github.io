<p>A <em>closed circuit</em> is one which allows electricity to flow and, in this case, to light the lightbulb.</p>

<p>A battery symbol resembles a stack of cells, the broad line indicating +ve and the short line indicating -ve).</p>

<h1 id="and-and-or-using-switches">AND and OR Using Switches</h1>

<p>In an AND circuit, both switches must be closed before electricity flows in the circuit.</p>

<p>In an OR circuit, either switch must be closed before electricity flows in the circuit.</p>

<h1 id="and-and-or-using-transistors">AND and OR Using Transistors</h1>

<p>In digital circuits, transistors are used like switches.</p>

<p>[<em>Aside: transistors are used differently in analog circuits.</em>]</p>

<p>The squiggly line is a <em>resistor</em>. Electricity flows in a circuit like water flows in a hose.  A <em>resistor</em> limits the amount of electricity that can flow, like a pinch in a hose.</p>

<p>Transistors canâ€™t handle as much electricity flow as switches can, so we insert a resistor to limit the electricity.  [<em>Aside: in fact, the lamp used in transistor circuits is usually a LED (light emitting diode) which needs less electricity than an incandescant lamp does.</em>]</p>
